urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.preface.1#So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of amnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the ivilization of earth, and adding the element of human fate to divine destiny; o long as the three great problems of the century—the degradation of man hrough pauperism, the corruption of woman through hunger, the crippling of hildren through lack of light—are unsolved; so long as social asphyxia is ossible in any part of the world;—in other words, and with a still wider ignificance, so long as ignorance and poverty exist on earth, books of the ature of Les Misérables cannot fail to be of use.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.head#CHAPTER I—M. MYRIEL
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.1#In 1815, M. Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D—— He was an ld man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D—— since 806.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.2#Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of hat we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake f exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which ad been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the iocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a lace in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. . Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he elonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him o be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or wenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in arliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that harles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather hort in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion f his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.3#The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the arliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed. M. harles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution. There is wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had o children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the rench society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic pectacles of ’93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who iewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,—did these ause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the idst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly mitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes verwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not hake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could have told: all hat was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.4#In 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Brignolles]. He was already dvanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.5#About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his uracy—just what, is not precisely known—took him to Paris. Among other powerful ersons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal esch. One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Curé, ho was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. apoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, urned round and said abruptly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.6#“Who is this good man who is staring at me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.7#“Sire,” said M. Myriel, “you are looking at a good man, and I at a great an. Each of us can profit by it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.8#That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé, and ome time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been ppointed Bishop of D——
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.9#What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to he early portion of M. Myriel’s life? No one knew. Very few families had been cquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.10#M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, here there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. He was bliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop. But fter all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,—noise, ayings, words; less than words—_palabres_, as the energetic language of the outh expresses it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.11#However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence n D——, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns nd petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion. No one would ave dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.12#M. Myriel had arrived at D—— accompanied by an elderly spinster, ademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.13#Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle aptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been _the servant of M. e Curé_, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper o Monseigneur.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.14#Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she ealized the ideal expressed by the word “respectable”; for it seems that a oman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been retty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, ad finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she dvanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. hat had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and his diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a irgin. Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to rovide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever rooping;—a mere pretext for a soul’s remaining on the earth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.15#Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and ustling; always out of breath,—in the first place, because of her activity, and n the next, because of her asthma.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.16#On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the onors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, n turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.1.17#The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.head#CHAPTER II—M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.1#The episcopal palace of D—— adjoins the hospital.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.2#The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the eginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the aculty of Paris, Abbé of Simore, who had been Bishop of D—— in 1712. This alace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand ir,—the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the rincipal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under rcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent rees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the round floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, n July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince ’Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de endôme, Grand Prior of France, Abbé of Saint Honoré de Lérins; François de erton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; César de Sabran de Forcalquier, ishop, Seignor of Glandève; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in rdinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven everend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th f July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white arble.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.3#The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small arden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.4#Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit nded, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.5#“Monsieur the director of the hospital,” said he to him, “how many sick eople have you at the present moment?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.6#“Twenty-six, Monseigneur.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.7#“That was the number which I counted,” said the Bishop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.8#“The beds,” pursued the director, “are very much crowded against each ther.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.9#“That is what I observed.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.10#“The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air an be changed in them.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.11#“So it seems to me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.12#“And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the onvalescents.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.13#“That was what I said to myself.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.14#“In case of epidemics,—we have had the typhus fever this year; we had the weating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,—we know not hat to do.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.15#“That is the thought which occurred to me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.16#“What would you have, Monseigneur?” said the director. “One must resign ne’s self.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.17#This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground loor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.18#The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the irector of the hospital.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.19#“Monsieur,” said he, “how many beds do you think this hall alone would old?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.20#“Monseigneur’s dining-room?” exclaimed the stupefied director.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.21#The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking easures and calculations with his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.22#“It would hold full twenty beds,” said he, as though speaking to himself. hen, raising his voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.23#“Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. here is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in five or six mall rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room for sixty. There is ome mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours. Give me back my ouse; you are at home here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.24#On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the ishop’s palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.25#M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the evolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, hich sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myriel received from he State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs. On the ery day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the isposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe ere a note made by his own hand:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.26#NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.28#M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that e occupied the see of D—— As has been seen, he called it _regulating his ousehold expenses_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.29#This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle aptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D—— as at one and the same ime her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her uperior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him. When he poke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence. Their only servant, adame Magloire, grumbled a little. It will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop ad reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension f Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen undred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.30#And when a village curate came to D——, the Bishop still found means to ntertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the ntelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.31#One day, after he had been in D—— about three months, the Bishop aid:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.32#“And still I am quite cramped with it all!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.33#“I should think so!” exclaimed Madame Magloire. “Monseigneur has not even laimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his arriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It was customary for ishops in former days.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.34#“Hold!” cried the Bishop, “you are quite right, Madame Magloire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.35#And he made his demand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.36#Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under onsideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this eading: _Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of osting, and expenses of pastoral visits._
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.37#This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of he Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 8 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the icinity of the town of D——, wrote to M. Bigot de Préameneu, the minister of ublic worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we xtract these authentic lines:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.38#“Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than our thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use of these trips, n the first place? Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these ountainous parts? There are no roads. No one travels otherwise than on orseback. Even the bridge between Durance and Château-Arnoux can barely support x-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and avaricious. This man played the ood priest when he first came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a arriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the lden days. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until he Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down with the Pope! Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Cæsar alone.” tc., etc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.39#On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. Good,” said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; “Monseigneur began with other eople, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He has regulated all is charities. Now here are three thousand francs for us! At last!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.40#That same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a emorandum conceived in the following terms:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.41#EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.42#For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres For he maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . . 250 ” For the maternity haritable society of Draguignan . . . 250 ” For foundlings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 ” For orphans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500 ” ——- Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000 ”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.43#Such was M. Myriel’s budget.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.44#As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, ispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, arriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more sperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.45#After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who acked knocked at M. Myriel’s door,—the latter in search of the alms which the ormer came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer f all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress. Considerable sums f money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any hange whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare ecessities.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.46#Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there is rotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was received. It as like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he received, he never had ny. Then he stripped himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.47#The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the ead of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the ountry-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among the names nd prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for them; and they never alled him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their xample, and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him. oreover, this appellation pleased him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.48#“I like that name,” said he. “Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.2.49#We do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we onfine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.head#CHAPTER III—A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.1#The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his arriage into alms. The diocese of D—— is a fatiguing one. There are very few lains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; hirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five uxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite a task.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.2#The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the eighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey n the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard or them, he went alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.3#One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was ounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit im any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of he town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of he citizens were laughing around him. “Monsieur the Mayor,” said the Bishop, and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant n a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done o from necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.4#In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked rather han preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and his examples. He uoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district. n the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, he said: “Look at the people f Briançon! They have conferred on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right o have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild heir houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a ountry which is blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a ingle murderer among them.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.5#In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: “Look at the eople of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his son way on service in the army, and his daughters at service in the town, and if he s ill and incapacitated, the curé recommends him to the prayers of the ongregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the inhabitants of the illage—men, women, and children—go to the poor man’s field and do his arvesting for him, and carry his straw and his grain to his granary.” To amilies divided by questions of money and inheritance he said: “Look at the ountaineers of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard here once in fifty years. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go ff to seek their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may ind husbands.” To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the armers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: “Look at those good easants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of them. Mon ieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff is known there. he mayor does everything. He allots the imposts, taxes each person onscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances without harge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a ust man among simple men.” To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he uoted once more the people of Queyras: “Do you know how they manage?” he said. Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a eacher, they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the ound of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and nstruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there. They are o be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat. hose who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach reading and reckoning ave two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. ut what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.3.6#Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he nvented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and many mages, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ. And eing convinced himself, he was persuasive.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.head#CHAPTER IV—WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.1#His conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with the wo old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the augh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [_Votre randeur_]. One day he rose from his armchair, and went to his library in search f a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves. As the bishop was rather hort of stature, he could not reach it. “Madame Magloire,” said he, “fetch me a hair. My greatness [_grandeur_] does not reach as far as that shelf.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.2#One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lô, rarely allowed an pportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as the expectations” of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very ld and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs. The youngest f the three was to receive from a grandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of ncome; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; he eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was ccustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal oasts. On one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, hile Madame de Lô was relating once again the details of all these inheritances nd all these “expectations.” She interrupted herself impatiently: “Mon Dieu, ousin!

In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar came to ——, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent. The subject of is sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid ell, which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, nd to win paradise, which he represented as charming and desirable. Among the udience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, amed M. Géborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse loth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Géborand estowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was bserved that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the oor of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. One day the Bishop aught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his ister, with a smile, “There is M. Géborand purchasing paradise for a sou.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.5#When it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a efusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced eflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; here was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, ho contrived to be, at one and the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ltra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actually existed. When the Bishop came o him, he touched his arm, _“You must give me something, M. le Marquis.”_ The arquis turned round and answered dryly, _“I have poor people of my own, onseigneur.” “Give them to me,”_ replied the Bishop.

And this arises from a thing which is alled the tax on doors and windows. Just put poor families, old women and ittle children, in those buildings, and behold the fevers and maladies which esult! Alas! God gives air to men; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the aw, but I bless God. In the department of the Isère, in the Var, in the two epartments of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even heelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have no andles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch. That s the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphiné. hey make bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung. In he winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it for wenty-four hours, in order to render it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold he suffering on all sides of you!”

He said, _“En bé! moussu, sés sagé?”_ as in lower Languedoc; _“Onté naras passa?”_ as in the Basses-Alpes; _“Puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen romage grase,”_ as in upper Dauphiné. This pleased the people extremely, and ontributed not a little to win him access to all spirits. He was perfectly at ome in the thatched cottage and in the mountains. He understood how to say the randest things in the most vulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he ntered into all hearts.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.9#Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower lasses. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into ccount. He said, “Examine the road over which the fault has passed.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.11#“Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his emptation. He drags it with him and yields to it.

A wretched man, being at the end of is resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for he child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with eath at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first alse piece made by the man. She was held, but there were no proofs except gainst her. She alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her onfession. She denied; they insisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an dea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the art of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly resented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that he man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her over, confessed all, proved all.

He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice. hey were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the leverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the ruth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop istened to all this in silence. When they had finished, he inquired,—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.23#A tragic event occurred at D—— A man was condemned to death for murder. He as a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public. The town took a great nterest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the ondemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill. A priest was needed to ttend the criminal in his last moments. They sent for the curé. It seems that e refused to come, saying, “That is no affair of mine. I have nothing to do ith that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and esides, it is not my place.” This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, “Monsieur le Curé is right: it is not his place; it is mine.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.24#He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the mountebank,” called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He assed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for he soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own. He old him the best truths, which are also the most simple. He was father, rother, friend; he was bishop only to bless. He taught him everything, ncouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dying in despair. Death as an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled ith horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His ondemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, ere and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and hich we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal reaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishop made him see light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.25#On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the ishop was still there.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.26#He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The ufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was adiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. The Bishop mbraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall, he said to im: “God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom his brothers have ejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe, enter into life: the Father s there.” When he descended from the scaffold, there was something in his look hich made the people draw aside to let him pass. They did not know which was ost worthy of admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the umble dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as _his palace_, he said to is sister, _“I have just officiated pontifically.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.27#Since the most sublime things are often those which are the least nderstood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on this onduct of the Bishop, _“It is affectation.”_

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.30#In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has omething about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain ndifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, rom saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one’s own yes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to ecide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others xecrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is alled _vindicate_; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain eutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social roblems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The caffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is ot a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of ood, iron and cords.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.31#It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre nitiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter’s work saw, that this achine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and hese cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditation into which its resence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise, and as though aking part in what is going on. The scaffold is the accomplice of the xecutioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort f monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to ive with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has nflicted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.4.32#Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following he execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed. he almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom f social justice tormented him. He, who generally returned from all his deeds ith a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he alked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is ne which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: “I did not think that t was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a egree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By what right o men touch that unknown thing?”

He understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long ours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had ost her child. As he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for peech. Oh, admirable consoler! He sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, ut to magnify and dignify it by hope. He said:—

Every uré furnished the pretext for a good meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With hat exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, nd oil soup.

He was a man f letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or six very curious anuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in Genesis, _In the eginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters_. With this verse he ompares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, _The winds of God blew;_ lavius Josephus who says, _A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth;_ nd finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, _A wind oming from God blew upon the face of the waters_.

As wood is extremely dear at D——, he hit upon the idea of having a ompartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings uring seasons of severe cold: he called it his _winter salon_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.5#In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture han a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to his the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in ater colors. Out of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and mitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his ratory.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.6#His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D—— had more than once ssessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur’s ratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor. The most beautiful of altars,” he said, “is the soul of an unhappy creature onsoled and thanking God.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.7#In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an armchair, lso in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received seven or eight ersons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the staff of the regiment n garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be etched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and he armchair from the bedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be ollected for the visitors.

Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in her own room very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been gilded, and which was overed with flowered pekin; but they had been obliged to hoist this bergère up o the first story through the window, as the staircase was too narrow; it could ot, therefore, be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture.

But this would have cost ive hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact that she had only been ble to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of ive years, she had ended by renouncing the idea. However, who is there who has ttained his ideal?

A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,—a ospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of the bed, ehind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the legant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors, one near the himney, opening into the oratory; the other near the bookcase, opening into the ining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with ooks; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually ithout fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above ith two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with ilver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of hreadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the lass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and ith huge volumes; before the table an armchair of straw; in front of the bed a rie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.

When the Bishop ucceeded to this apartment, after the hospital patients, he had found these ortraits there, and had left them. They were priests, and probably donors—two easons for respecting them. All that he knew about these two persons was, that hey had been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his enefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire having taken he pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars written n whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, and attached to he back of the portrait of the Abbé of Grand-Champ with four wafers.

This seam ook the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it: “How elightful that is!” he said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.14#All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor s well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in arracks and hospitals.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.15#However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the aper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment of ademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming a hospital, his house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois. Hence this ecoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, ith straw mats in front of all the beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was ttended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was he sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, _“That takes nothing from he poor.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.16#It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former ossessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire ontemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the oarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D—— as he was in eality, we must add that he had said more than once, “I find it difficult to enounce eating from silver dishes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.17#To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, hich he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two wax andles, and usually figured on the Bishop’s chimney-piece. When he had any one o dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on he table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.18#In the Bishop’s own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small upboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and he big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never emoved.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.19#The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we ave mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating from a ank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall hich enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with ox. In three of these, Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, he Bishop had planted some flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. adame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: “Monseigneur, ou who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It ould be better to grow salads there than bouquets.” “Madame Magloire,” retorted he Bishop, “you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful.” He dded after a pause, “More so, perhaps.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.20#This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost as uch as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming, hoeing, nd making holes here and there in the earth, into which he dropped seeds. He as not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him. oreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignored groups and consistency; e made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural ethod; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with ussieu against Linnæus. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected earned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever ailing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening ith a tin watering-pot painted green.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.21#The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the ining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, ad formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison. The ishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, ither by night or by day, with anything except the latch. All that the first asser-by had to do at any hour, was to give it a push. At first, the two women ad been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de —— had said to them, “Have bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.” hey had ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they hared it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the ishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three ines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, “This is the shade of difference: he door of the physician should never be shut, the door of the priest should lways be open.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.22#On another book, entitled _Philosophy of the Medical Science_, he had ritten this other note: “Am not I a physician like them? I also have my atients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.23#Again he wrote: “Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you. he very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.24#It chanced that a worthy curé, I know not whether it was the curé of ouloubroux or the curé of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, robably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that e was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door nfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, nd whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a ouse so little guarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, nd said to him, _“Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui ustodiunt eam,” Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who uard it._
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.6.25#Then he spoke of something else.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.7.2#After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bès, who had infested the orges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in the ountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of aspard Bès’s troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Piédmont, nd suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette. He was first een at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid himself in the caverns of the oug-de-l’Aigle, and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages hrough the ravines of Ubaye and Ubayette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.7.3#He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and espoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the country-side. The endarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He always escaped; sometimes he esisted by main force. He was a bold wretch. In the midst of all this terror he Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to eet him, and urged him to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the ountains as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it erely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.

They are my good riends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own one goat out of every hirty that they tend. They make very pretty woollen cords of various colors, nd they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes. They need to be old of the good God now and then.

The poor priest went to his poor ountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I et out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a athedral.”

Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new irection to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of he poor. However, we make no assertions on this point.

He was n old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered ll the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, nd even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good pportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was ntelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of picurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed illingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the “crotchets f that good old fellow the Bishop.” He even sometimes laughed at him with an miable authority in the presence of M.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.8.11#“I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a eliever in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport f Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham’s eels prove that God is useless. A rop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the _fiat lux_. Suppose he drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world. Man is the el. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father? The Jehovah hypothesis tires e, Bishop. It is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose easoning is hollow. Down with that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for ero which leaves me in peace! Between you and me, and in order to empty my ack, and make confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to ou that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches enunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. ‘Tis the counsel of an varicious man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end?

Ah! what charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a fine lot Adam has! We are ouls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades.

Beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness. You have been ardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul—it makes no difference. That is the ruth. Then live your life, above all things. Make use of your _I_ while you ave it. In truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I ave my philosophers. I don’t let myself be taken in with that nonsense. Of ourse, there must be something for those who are down,—for the barefooted eggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches. Legends, chimæras, the soul, mmortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble t down. They spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good od.

The Bishop of D——, in pite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him, sometimes did hings that were grand, bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a uspicion of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone. Sometimes Madame agloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor fterwards. They never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any ction once entered upon. At certain moments, without his having occasion to ention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so erfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; hen they were nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served him assively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. They nderstood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be ut under constraint. Thus, even when believing him to be in peril, they nderstood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that hey no longer watched over him. They confided him to God.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.40#The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did ot think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for hese petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest: he, ho on occasion, was so fond of laughing at “His Grace,” was rather shocked at ot being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort citizen.” He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to octors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, his member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one f the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the ishop felt in a mood to be severe.

A member of the Convention produced on him omewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of harity. G——, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of hose octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. he Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man ne was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he reserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in he robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to isconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have urned back, and thought that he had mistaken the door. G—— seemed to be dying ecause he willed it so. There was freedom in his agony. His legs alone were otionless. It was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and ead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of ight. G——, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient ho was flesh above and marble below.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.49#“I mean to say that man has a tyrant,—ignorance. I voted for the death of hat tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely nderstood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be overned only by science.”

You ave told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to our moral personality. In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You are a ishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded men with eraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,—the bishopric of D—— ifteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, wenty-five thousand francs,—who have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good heer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a lackey ehind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages n the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are a prelate,—revenues, alace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have his like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says ither too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and ssential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing isdom to me.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.90#The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness f a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred to him; but e was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The best of minds will have heir fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect f logic.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.91#The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is mingled ith the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a perfect lucidity f soul in his eyes. He went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.92#“Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing. part from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human ffirmation, ’93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir; but what f the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to ontrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is your opinion as to amoignon-Bâville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please? uchêne senior is ferocious; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder etellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the arquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and ueen; but I am also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under ouis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the aist, to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with ilk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that reast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a urse, ‘Abjure!’ giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the eath of her conscience. What say you to that torture of Tantalus as applied to mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for xistence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world ade better. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the uman race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am ying.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.93#And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his houghts in these tranquil words:—

One remained, however, and from this ntrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu’s resistance, came forth his reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.96#“Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor. He ho is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.97#The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized with fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered lowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he aid, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were lunged in the depths:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.98#“O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.99#The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.102#The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with he shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken, his yes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he had just lived hrough in a moment the few hours which had been left to him. That which he had aid brought him nearer to him who is in death. The supreme moment was pproaching.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.103#The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he had ome: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion; he azed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-cold hand in is, and bent over the dying man.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.10.106#“Bishop,” said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his ignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, “I have passed my life in editation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of age when my country alled me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs. I obeyed. Abuses xisted, I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights and rinciples existed, I proclaimed and confessed them. Our territory was invaded, defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am oor. I have been one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury ere encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the alls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and ilver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored the ppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from the altar, it s true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. I have always upheld he march forward of the human race, forward towards the light, and I have ometimes resisted progress without pity. I have, when the occasion offered, rotected my own adversaries, men of your profession. And there is at Peteghem, n Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer alace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I aved in 1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good that was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, eered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past, I with my white air have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise e; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned. And I accept his isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six ears old; I am on the point of death. What is it that you have come to ask of e?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.1#We should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to conclude rom this that Monseigneur Welcome was “a philosophical bishop,” or a “patriotic uré.” His meeting, which may almost be designated as his union, with onventionary G——, left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment, which endered him still more gentle. That is all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.2#Although Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is, erhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events f that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed of having an ttitude.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.3#Let us, then, go back a few years.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.4#Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperor ad made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops. The rrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to he 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to he synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at Paris. This synod was eld at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, nder the presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five ishops who attended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at three or our private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close to ature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these minent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly. He very oon returned to D—— He was interrogated as to this speedy return, and he eplied: _“I embarrassed them. The outside air penetrated to them through me. I roduced on them the effect of an open door.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.5#On another occasion he said, _“What would you have? Those gentlemen are rinces. I am only a poor peasant bishop.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.6#The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is said hat he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at the house of one f his most notable colleagues: “What beautiful clocks! What beautiful carpets! hat beautiful liveries! They must be a great trouble. I would not have all hose superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears: ‘There are people who are ungry! There are people who are cold! There are poor people! There are poor eople!’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.7#Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent atred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, in hurchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations and eremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable bout them. An opulent priest is a contradiction. The priest must keep close to he poor. Now, can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this istress, all these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one’s wn person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to magine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a workman who is orking near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, or a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first proof of harity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.8#This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D—— thought.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.9#It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the “ideas of he century” on certain delicate points. He took very little part in the heological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which hurch and State were implicated; but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems hat he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican. ince we are making a portrait, and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we re forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning ith 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. e refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island of lba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor in his iocese during the Hundred Days.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.10#Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a eneral, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency. He was arsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command in Provence at he epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had put himself at the ead of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor as though the latter had een a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape. His correspondence ith the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in etirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.11#Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour of itterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this rand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things. Certainly, such a man ould have done well not to entertain any political opinions. Let there be no istake as to our meaning: we are not confounding what is called “political pinions” with the grand aspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, atriotic, democratic, humane, which in our day should be the very foundation of very generous intellect. Without going deeply into questions which are only ndirectly connected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this: It ould have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a Royalist, and if his lance had never been, for a single instant, turned away from that serene ontemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the fictions and the atreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the eaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.12#While admitting that it was not for a political office that God created onseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest in the ame of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilous esistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases us in people who re rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling. We only love he fray so long as there is danger, and in any case, the combatants of the irst hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last.

The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. s for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 ommenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn egislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which aroused ndignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those arshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senate which passed from one unghill to another, insulting after having deified; in the presence of that dolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,—it was a duty o turn aside the head. In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when rance was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could e dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army nd the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it, and, fter making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of ——, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching eatures presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink f the abyss.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.11.13#With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable, ntelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only another ort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must be admitted, hat even in the political views with which we have just reproached him, and hich we are disposed to judge almost with severity, he was tolerant and easy, ore so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here. The porter of the town-hall had een placed there by the Emperor. He was an old non-commissioned officer of the ld guard, a member of the Legion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a onapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate emarks, which the law then stigmatized as _seditious speeches_. After the mperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself n his regimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear his ross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which apoleon had given him; this made a hole, and he would not put anything in its lace. _“I will die,”_ he said, _“rather than wear the three frogs upon my eart!”_ He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. “The gouty old creature in nglish gaiters!” he said; _“let him take himself off to Prussia with that queue f his.”_ He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which e most detested, Prussia and England. He did it so often that he lost his lace. There he was, turned out of the house, with his wife and children, and ithout bread. The Bishop sent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed him eadle in the cathedral.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.12.1#A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbés, ust as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what that charming aint François de Sales calls somewhere “les prêtres blancs-becs,” callow riests. Every career has its aspirants, who form a train for those who have ttained eminence in it. There is no power which has not its dependents. There s no fortune which has not its court. The seekers of the future eddy around the plendid present. Every metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who ossesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the eminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal alace, and mounts guard over monseigneur’s smile. To please a bishop is quivalent to getting one’s foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is ecessary to walk one’s path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the anonship.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.12.2#Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church. hese are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed, kilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who know lso how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance ttendance in their person, who are connecting links between the sacristy and iplomacy, who are abbés rather than priests, prelates rather than bishops. appy those who approach them! Being persons of influence, they create a shower bout them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who nderstand the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, haplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As they dvance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; it is a whole olar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their uite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little romotions. The larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the avorite. And then, there is Rome. A bishop who understands how to become an rchbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with im as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the allium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then onsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the minence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap ay dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a ing in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what a nursery f aspirations is a seminary! How many blushing choristers, how many youthful bbés bear on their heads Perrette’s pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for mbition to call itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving tself, devotee that it is.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.12.3#Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the ig mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him. e have seen that he “did not take” in Paris. Not a single future dreamed of ngrafting itself on this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition ommitted the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow. His canons and rand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him n this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, ith this difference, that they were finished and he was completed. The mpossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well nderstood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary han they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and ent off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. A aint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might ommunicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the oints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than ou desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of onseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is he lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.12.4#Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false esemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost the same rofile as supremacy. Success, that Menæchmus of talent, has one dupe,—history. uvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day, a philosophy which is lmost official has entered into its service, wears the livery of success, and erforms the service of its antechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues apacity. Win in the lottery, and behold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs s venerated. Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in hat. Be lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think ou great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor f a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding s gold. It does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you o arrive. The common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who pplauds the vulgar herd. That enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, schylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, nd by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may onsist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a false Corneille ompose _Tiridate;_ let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military rudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary nvent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct or himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand rancs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth even or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the other; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the teward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made inister of finances,—and men call that Genius, just as they call the face of ousqueton _Beauty_, and the mien of Claude _Majesty_. With the constellations f space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of he puddle by the feet of ducks.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.1#We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D—— on the score of orthodoxy. In he presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect. The onscience of the just man should be accepted on his word. Moreover, certain atures being given, we admit the possible development of all beauties of human irtue in a belief that differs from our own.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.2#What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of the nner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where souls enter aked. The point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith ever resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case. No decay is possible to he diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers. _“Credo in Patrem,”_ he ften exclaimed. Moreover, he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction hich suffices to the conscience, and which whispers to a man, “Thou art with od!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.3#The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and eyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. It was in hat quarter, _quia multum amavit_,—because he loved much—that he was regarded s vulnerable by “serious men,” “grave persons” and “reasonable people”; avorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from edantry. What was this excess of love? It was a serene benevolence which verflowed men, as we have already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended ven to things. He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God’s reation. Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which e reserves for animals. The Bishop of D—— had none of that harshness, which is eculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as the Brahmin, but e seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: “Who knoweth whither the oul of the animal goeth?” Hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, roubled him not, and did not arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost oftened by them. It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond he bounds of life which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse or them. He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. He xamined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a alimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature. This reverie ometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was in his garden, and hought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind him, unseen by him: uddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it was a large, black, airy, frightful spider. His sister heard him say:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.5#Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness? Puerile hey may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to Saint Francis ’Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained his ankle in his effort to void stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just man. Sometimes he fell asleep in is garden, and then there was nothing more venerable possible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.6#Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth, and ven in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate, and, possibly, violent man. His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the esult of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the edium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a haracter, as in a rock, there may exist apertures made by drops of water. These ollows are uneffaceable; these formations are indestructible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.7#In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth irthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall; he was ather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond of taking long trolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was but slightly bent, a detail rom which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of ighty, held himself erect and smiling, which did not prevent him from being a ad bishop. Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term a “fine head,” but so miable was he that they forgot that it was fine.

His fresh and ruddy complexion, his ery white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his mile, gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a an, “He’s a good fellow”; and of an old man, “He is a fine man.” That, it will e recalled, was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first ncounter, and to one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, ut a fine man. But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in he least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and took n some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious brow, rendered ugust by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation; majesty adiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radiant; one xperienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling ngel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable espect, penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that ne had before him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls here thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.9#As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion, lms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit of land, raternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study, work, illed every day of his life. _Filled_ is exactly the word; certainly the ishop’s day was quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds. evertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing n hour or two in his garden before going to bed, and after the two women had etired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber y meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. ometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly long the walks at a very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, ommuning with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart ith the serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor f the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to he thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his eart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a amp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of he universal radiance of creation, he could not have told himself, probably, hat was passing in his spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and omething descend into him. Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with he abysses of the universe!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.10#He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity, hat strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more strange; of all he infinities, which pierced their way into all his senses, beneath his eyes; nd, without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He id not study God; he was dazzled by him. He considered those magnificent onjunctions of atoms, which communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by erifying them, create individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the nnumerable in the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These onjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.11#He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit ine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his ruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so encumbered with mean uildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfied his wants.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.13.12#What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his life, here there was so little leisure, between gardening in the daytime and ontemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, with the heavens for a eiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works, in urn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and what is there left to desire eyond it? A little garden in which to walk, and immensity in which to dream. At ne’s feet that which can be cultivated and plucked; over head that which one an study and meditate upon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the ky.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.head#CHAPTER XIV—WHAT HE THOUGHT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.1#One last word.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.2#Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, and o use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D—— a certain pantheistical” physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to his credit or iscredit, that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are eculiar to our century, which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, and here take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist pon it, that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have hought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened his man was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from here.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.3#No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no, there is othing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. The apostle may be aring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably have felt a scruple at ounding too far in advance certain problems which are, in a manner, reserved or terrible great minds. There is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the nigma; those gloomy openings stand yawning there, but something tells you, you, passer-by in life, that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates hither!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.4#Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation, ituated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas to God. Their rayer audaciously offers discussion. Their adoration interrogates. This is irect religion, which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who ttempts its steep cliffs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.5#Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes and igs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by a sort of plendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious world which urrounds us renders back what it has received; it is probable that the ontemplators are contemplated. However that may be, there are on earth men ho—are they men?—perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of reverie he heights of the absolute, and who have the terrible vision of the infinite ountain. Monseigneur Welcome was one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not genius. He would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men ven, like Swedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these owerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths one pproaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which shortens,—the ospel’s.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.6#He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah’s mantle; e projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events; he did not ee to condense in flame the light of things; he had nothing of the prophet and othing of the magician about him. This humble soul loved, and that was all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.7#That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable: ut one can no more pray too much than one can love too much; and if it is a eresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint Jerome would be eretics.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.8#He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe ppeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever, everywhere he eard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to solve the enigma, he trove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle of created things developed enderness in him; he was occupied only in finding for himself, and in inspiring thers with the best way to compassionate and relieve. That which exists was for his good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought onsolation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.9#There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction of ity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned everywhere was ut an excuse for unfailing kindness. _Love each other;_ he declared this to be omplete, desired nothing further, and that was the whole of his doctrine. One ay, that man who believed himself to be a “philosopher,” the senator who has lready been alluded to, said to the Bishop: “Just survey the spectacle of the orld: all war against all; the strongest has the most wit. Your _love each ther_ is nonsense.”—_“Well,”_ replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting he point, _“if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as the earl in the oyster.”_ Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he was bsolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious questions which ttract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of abstraction, the precipices f metaphysics—all those profundities which converge, for the apostle in God, or the atheist in nothingness; destiny, good and evil, the way of being against eing, the conscience of man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the ransformation in death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb ontains, the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent I_, the essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature, iberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, where lean the igantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses, which Lucretius, anou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyes flashing lightning, which seems y its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.1.14.10#Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of ysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling his own ind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for arkness.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.head#CHAPTER I—THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.1#Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man who as travelling on foot entered the little town of D—— The few inhabitants who ere at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this raveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of ore wretched appearance. He was a man of medium stature, thickset and robust, n the prime of life. He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A ap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned y sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow inen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his airy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, orn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray, attered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on ith twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, n his back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his tockingless feet; a shaved head and a long beard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.2#The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not what ordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely cut, yet ristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to have been cut or some time.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.3#No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he? rom the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance into D—— by he same street which, seven months previously, had witnessed the passage of the mperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes to Paris. This man must have been alking all day. He seemed very much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market own which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of he boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the romenade. He must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw im stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in the arket-place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.4#On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left, and irected his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out a quarter of n hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the stone bench which eneral Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng f the inhabitants of D—— the proclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off is cap and humbly saluted the gendarme.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.5#The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him, ollowed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.6#There then existed at D—— a fine inn at the sign of the _Cross of Colbas_. his inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man of consideration in he town on account of his relationship to another Labarre, who kept the inn of he _Three Dauphins_ in Grenoble, and had served in the Guides. At the time of he Emperor’s landing, many rumors had circulated throughout the country with egard to this inn of the _Three Dauphins_. It was said that General Bertrand, isguised as a carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, nd that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of old to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he ad refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he had thanked he mayor, saying, _“I am going to the house of a brave man of my cquaintance”;_ and he had betaken himself to the _Three Dauphins_. This glory f the Labarre of the _Three Dauphins_ was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas_, at a distance of five and twenty leagues. It was said of him n the town, _“That is the cousin of the man of Grenoble.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.7#The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the ountry-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the street. ll the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace. The ost, who was also the chief cook, was going from one stew-pan to another, very usily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners, whose loud alking, conversation, and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. ny one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better heer than wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and eather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two uge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.8#The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said, without aising his eyes from his stoves:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.9#“What do you wish, sir?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.10#“Food and lodging,” said the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.11#“Nothing easier,” replied the host. At that moment he turned his head, ook in the traveller’s appearance with a single glance, and added, “By paying or it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.12#The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and nswered, “I have money.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.13#“In that case, we are at your service,” said the host.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.14#The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his ack, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his hand, and eated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D—— is in the mountains. The venings are cold there in October.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.15#But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.16#“Will dinner be ready soon?” said the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.17#“Immediately,” replied the landlord.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.18#While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back urned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket, then ore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near he window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two, folded it without ealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve im in the capacity both of scullion and lackey. The landlord whispered a word n the scullion’s ear, and the child set off on a run in the direction of the own-hall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.19#The traveller saw nothing of all this.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.21#“Immediately,” responded the host.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.22#The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it agerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read it ttentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment. Then he ook a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to be immersed in eflections which were not very serene.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.23#“I cannot receive you, sir,” said he.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.37#This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger as rave. He rose.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.49#Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him tart, “Go away!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.50#At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands nto the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned quickly round, and s he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed steadily at him and added, still n a low voice: “Stop! there’s enough of that sort of talk. Do you want me to ell you your name? Your name is Jean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you ho you are? When I saw you come in I suspected something; I sent to the own-hall, and this was the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.54#He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture, keeping lose to the houses like a sad and humiliated man.

In the idst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single tory, the window of which was lighted up. He peered through the pane as he had one at the public house. Within was a large whitewashed room, with a bed draped n printed cotton stuff, and a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a ouble-barrelled gun hanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of he room. A copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the ewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking oup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and open ountenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close by a very young oman was nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child was aughing, the mother was smiling.

He carried his head thrown ackwards; his shirt, widely opened and turned back, displayed his bull neck, hite and bare.

By the ight of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens which ordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be built of sods. He limbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found himself in the garden. He pproached the hut; its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture, and it esembled those buildings which road-laborers construct for themselves along the oads. He thought without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a oad-laborer; he was suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a helter from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night. e threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warm there, nd he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment, stretched out n this bed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued was he. Then, as he knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow eady to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a erocious growl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog as outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.121#He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town, hoping o find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter.

When he felt imself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazed earchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of those low hills overed with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest, resemble shaved eads.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.1.123#The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of ight; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the ill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole sky. Meanwhile, as he moon was about to rise, and as there was still floating in the zenith a emnant of the brightness of twilight, these clouds formed at the summit of the ky a sort of whitish arch, whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.1#That evening, the Bishop of D——, after his promenade through the town, emained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work on Duties_, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefully compiling verything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject. is book was divided into two parts: firstly, the duties of all; secondly, the uties of each individual, according to the class to which he belongs. The uties of all are the great duties. There are four of these. Saint Matthew oints them out: duties towards God (_Matt._ vi.); duties towards one’s self _Matt._ v. 29, 30); duties towards one’s neighbor (_Matt._ vii. 12); duties owards animals (_Matt._ vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found hem pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the pistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, by aint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants, in the Epistle to the phesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the Hebrews; to virgins, in the pistle to the Corinthians. Out of these precepts he was laboriously onstructing a harmonious whole, which he desired to present to souls.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.2#At eight o’clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal of nconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on his knees, hen Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the silver-ware from he cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop, knowing that the table as set, and that his sister was probably waiting for him, shut his book, rose rom his table, and entered the dining-room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.3#The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a door pening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on the garden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.4#Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the able.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.5#As she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle aptistine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.6#A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood fire as burning there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.7#One can easily picture to one’s self these two women, both of whom were ver sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle aptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at hat date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, hich possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a hole page would hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant_, and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a _lady_. Madame Magloire wore a hite quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the nly bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white fichu uffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short leeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the aist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at he upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the omen of Marseilles. Mademoiselle Baptistine’s gown was cut on the patterns of 806, with a short waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with laps and buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby_ wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the wo corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger han the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look. So long as onseigneur held his peace, she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of espect and freedom; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, he obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even peak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never been retty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent eyes, and a long rched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth an ineffable oodness, as we stated in the beginning. She had always been predestined to entleness; but faith, charity, hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the oul, had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a amb, religion had made her an angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which as vanished!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.8#Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal esidence that evening, that there are many people now living who still recall he most minute details.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.9#At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with onsiderable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a subject hich was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also accustomed. The uestion concerned the lock upon the entrance door.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.10#It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame agloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a prowler of vil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about he town, and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that ight might be subjected to unpleasant encounters. The police was very badly rganized, moreover, because there was no love lost between the Prefect and the ayor, who sought to injure each other by making things happen. It behooved wise eople to play the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and are must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to _fasten he doors well_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.11#Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just come rom his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front of the fire, nd warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of other things. He did not take p the remark dropped with design by Madame Magloire. She repeated it. Then ademoiselle Baptistine, desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without ispleasing her brother, ventured to say timidly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.12#“Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.13#“I have heard something of it in a vague way,” replied the Bishop. Then alf-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising towards he old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew joyous, and which as illuminated from below by the firelight,—“Come, what is the matter? What is he matter? Are we in any great danger?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.14#Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a ittle without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a are-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment in the own. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre’s to obtain lodgings, but the atter had not been willing to take him in. He had been seen to arrive by the ay of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming. A allows-bird with a terrible face.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.15#“Really!” said the Bishop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.16#This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed to er to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed; she ursued triumphantly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.17#“Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort of atastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the police is o badly regulated” (a useful repetition). “The idea of living in a mountainous ountry, and not even having lights in the streets at night! One goes out. Black s ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur, and Mademoiselle there says with e—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.18#“I,” interrupted his sister, “say nothing. What my brother does is well one.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.19#Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.2.20#“We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur will ermit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and replace he ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only the work of a oment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened rom the outside with a latch by the first passer-by; and I say that we need olts, Monseigneur, if only for this night; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit f always saying ‘come in’; and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon ieu! there is no need to ask permission.”

Pardon me, I say that very badly; but it is such a ar-off thing to me! You understand what we are! He said mass in the middle of he galleys, on an altar.

There are paper mills, tanneries, istilleries, oil factories, watch factories on a large scale, steel mills, opper works, twenty iron foundries at least, four of which, situated at Lods, t Châtillon, at Audincourt, and at Beure, are tolerably large.’

It is towards the end of April that he work of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that the heese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.’
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.4.20#“The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink that ood Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says that wine is xpensive. My brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his ith which you are acquainted, interspersing his words with graceful attentions o me. He recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of _grurin_, as though e wished the man to understand, without advising him directly and harshly, that his would afford him a refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have old you. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my rother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when e entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother as. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon, nd of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the passage might emain behind. This might have appeared to any one else who had this, nfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as is body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and dvice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better n the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came, nor hat was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and my brother seemed o avoid everything which could remind him of it. To such a point did he carry t, that at one time, when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of ontarlier, _who exercise a gentle labor near heaven, and who_, he added, _are appy because they are innocent_, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark here might have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of eflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother’s heart. e was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his isfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was to ivert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a erson like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this ndeed, to understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly vangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from llusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch t at all? It has seemed to me that this might have been my brother’s private hought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, e gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he s every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in he same manner in which he would have supped with M. Gédéon le Prévost, or with he curate of the parish.

My brother kissed he child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I had about me to give to other Gerbaud. The man was not paying much heed to anything then. He was no onger talking, and he seemed very much fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had aken her departure, my brother said grace; then he turned to the man and said o him, ‘You must be in great need of your bed.’ Madame Magloire cleared the able very promptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this raveller to go to sleep, and we both went upstairs. Nevertheless, I sent Madame agloire down a moment later, to carry to the man’s bed a goat skin from the lack Forest, which was in my room. The nights are frigid, and that keeps one arm. It is a pity that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.1#Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.2#Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learned to ead in his childhood. When he reached man’s estate, he became a tree-pruner at averolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his father was called Jean aljean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and a contraction of _voilà_ Jean, here’s Jean.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.3#Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which onstitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole, however, here was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about Jean Valjean in ppearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother at a very early age. His other had died of a milk fever, which had not been properly attended to. His ather, a tree-pruner, like himself, had been killed by a fall from a tree. All hat remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older than himself,—a widow with even children, boys and girls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so ong as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.4#The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old. The oungest, one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.5#Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the father’s lace, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought him up. This was one simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of Jean Valjean. hus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil. He had never known a kind woman friend” in his native parts. He had not had the time to fall in ove.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.6#He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word. His ister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from his bowl hile he was eating,—a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heart of the abbage,—to give to one of her children. As he went on eating, with his head ent over the table and almost into his soup, his long hair falling about his owl and concealing his eyes, he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing t. There was at Faverolles, not far from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the ther side of the lane, a farmer’s wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean hildren, habitually famished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint f milk, in their mother’s name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some lley corner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls pilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother had known of his marauding, she would have punished the delinquents severely. Jean Valjean ruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for the pint of milk behind their other’s back, and the children were not punished.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.7#In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as a ay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He did whatever he ould. His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children? t was a sad group enveloped in misery, which was being gradually annihilated. A ery hard winter came. Jean had no work. The family had no bread. No bread iterally. Seven children!

He arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole ade by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the glass. The arm seized a oaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran out in haste; the robber fled at he full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran after him and stopped him. The thief had lung away the loaf, but his arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.9#This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of the ime for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night. He had a un which he used better than any one else in the world, he was a bit of a oacher, and this injured his case. There exists a legitimate prejudice against oachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. evertheless, we will remark cursorily, there is still an abyss between these aces of men and the hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the orest, the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make erocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, ake savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without destroying the umane side.

What an ominous minute is that in which society raws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being! Jean aljean was condemned to five years in the galleys.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.11#On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the eneral-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory to the ive Hundred, of the 2d of Floréal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte, was announced n Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves was put in chains at icêtre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, ho is now nearly eighty years old, still recalls perfectly that unfortunate retch who was chained to the end of the fourth line, in the north angle of the ourtyard. He was seated on the ground like the others. He did not seem to omprehend his position, except that it was horrible. It is probable that he, lso, was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of verything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was being iveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears tifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles.” Then still sobbing, he raised his right and and lowered it gradually seven times, as though he were touching in uccession seven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was divined hat the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done for the sake of lothing and nourishing seven little children.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.12#He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-seven ays, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in the red assock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name, was effaced; he as no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601. What became of his ister? What became of the seven children? Who troubled himself about that? What ecomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the oot?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.13#It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures of od, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge, wandered away at andom,—who even knows?—each in his own direction perhaps, and little by little uried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy hades, into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre arch of the human race. They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had een their village forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field orgot them; after a few years’ residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself orgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. That s all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, did he hear his ister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards the end of the fourth year of is captivity. I know not through what channels the news reached him. Some one ho had known them in their own country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. he lived in a poor street near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had ith her only one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? erhaps she did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing office, o. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She was obliged to be here at six o’clock in the morning—long before daylight in winter. In the same uilding with the printing office there was a school, and to this school she ook her little boy, who was seven years old. But as she entered the printing ffice at six, and the school only opened at seven, the child had to wait in the ourtyard, for the school to open, for an hour—one hour of a winter night in the pen air! They would not allow the child to come into the printing office, ecause he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in the morning, hey beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome with rowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down and doubled up ver his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; he took him into her den, where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two ooden chairs, and the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close o the cat that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o’clock the school pened, and he entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.

He heard nothing more forever. Nothing from hem ever reached him again; he never beheld them; he never met them again; and n the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any ore.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.6.15#Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean’s turn to escape arrived. is comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped. He andered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be unted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be fraid of everything,—of a smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of galloping horse, of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the ight because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. n the evening of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept or thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime, to a rolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years. In the sixth ear his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, but could not ccomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon were fired, nd at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process f construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and ebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an ddition of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the enth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no etter. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it as during his thirteenth year, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in etting retaken at the end of four hours of absence. Three years for those four ours. Nineteen years. In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there n 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.

This is the second time, during his studies n the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of this book has ome across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the isaster of a destiny.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.3#He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The light f nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses a clearness of ision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this ind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in the cell, in hardship, beneath he burning sun of the galleys, upon the plank bed of the convict, he withdrew nto his own consciousness and meditated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.4#He constituted himself the tribunal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.5#He began by putting himself on trial.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.6#He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished. e admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act; that that loaf f bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it; that, n any case, it would have been better to wait until he could get it through ompassion or through work; that it is not an unanswerable argument to say, “Can ne wait when one is hungry?” That, in the first place, it is very rare for any ne to die of hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, an is so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and hysically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have patience; that hat would even have been better for those poor little children; that it had een an act of madness for him, a miserable, unfortunate wretch, to take society t large violently by the collar, and to imagine that one can escape from misery hrough theft; that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from isery through which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.7#Then he asked himself:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.8#Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether it as not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he, an ndustrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault once committed nd confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned. hether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law, in respect to the enalty, than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault. hether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale, in he one which contains expiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not quivalent to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing the ituation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the epression, of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtor into he creditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had iolated it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.9#Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for attempts t escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the tronger upon the feebler, a crime of society against the individual, a crime hich was being committed afresh every day, a crime which had lasted nineteen ears.

He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm hich he had caused and the harm which was being done to him; he finally arrived t the conclusion that his punishment was not, in truth, unjust, but that it ost assuredly was iniquitous.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.15#Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully; one s exasperated only when there is some show of right on one’s side at bottom. ean Valjean felt himself exasperated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.16#And besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had never een anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and which it hows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to bruise him. Every ontact with them had been a blow. Never, since his infancy, since the days of is mother, of his sister, had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly lance. From suffering to suffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction hat life is a war; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other eapon than his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away ith him when he departed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.17#There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantin riars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the nfortunate men who had a mind for them.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.25#Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, as erfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read s? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their formation, and had he seen istinctly during the process of their formation, all the elements of which his oral misery was composed? Had this rough and unlettered man gathered a erfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had, by egrees, mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many ears, formed the inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that assed within him, and of all that was working there? That is something which we o not presume to state; it is something which we do not even believe. There was oo much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his misfortune, to prevent much agueness from still lingering there. At times he did not rightly know himself hat he felt. Jean Valjean was in the shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he ated in the shadows; one might have said that he hated in advance of himself. e dwelt habitually in this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a reamer. Only, at intervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from ithin, an access of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid and rapid flash hich illuminated his whole soul, and caused to appear abruptly all around him, n front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, the hideous precipices nd the sombre perspective of his destiny.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.26#The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He no onger knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which that which is itiless—that is to say, that which is brutalizing—predominates, is to transform man, little by little, by a sort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; ometimes into a ferocious beast.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.27#Jean Valjean’s successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone uffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul. Jean aljean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and foolish as they ere, as often as the opportunity had presented itself, without reflecting for n instant on the result, nor on the experiences which he had already gone hrough. He escaped impetuously, like the wolf who finds his cage open. Instinct aid to him, “Flee!” Reason would have said, “Remain!” But in the presence of so iolent a temptation, reason vanished; nothing remained but instinct. The beast lone acted. When he was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only erved to render him still more wild.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.28#One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical trength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the alleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean Valjean as worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his ack; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced that implement which is alled a jack-screw, and was formerly called _orgueil_ [pride], whence, we may emark in passing, is derived the name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, hen they were repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those dmirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and as on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the aryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.29#His suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who were orever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of force and kill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system of mysterious tatics is daily practised by prisoners, men who are forever envious of the lies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to find points of support here hardly a projection was visible, was play to Jean Valjean. An angle of the all being given, with the tension of his back and legs, with his elbows and his eels fitted into the unevenness of the stone, he raised himself as if by magic o the third story. He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley rison.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.30#He spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion was equired to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laugh of the onvict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To all appearance, he eemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.31#He was absorbed, in fact.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.32#Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed ntelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting n him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled, each time that e turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, he perceived with terror, ingled with rage, a sort of frightful accumulation of things, collecting and ounting above him, beyond the range of his vision,—laws, prejudices, men, and eeds,—whose outlines escaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was othing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He istinguished, here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, ow afar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail, vividly lluminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the gendarme and his word; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top, like a sort of sun, the mperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him that these distant splendors, ar from dissipating his night, rendered it more funereal and more black. All his—laws, prejudices, deeds, men, things—went and came above him, over his ead, in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which God mparts to civilization, walking over him and crushing him with I know not what eacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which ave fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the owest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of the aw, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for him who is ithout, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon their heads.

Everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd; everything hat surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He said to himself, “It is a ream.” He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a few paces from him; the alley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of a sudden the phantom dealt him a low with his cudgel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.37#Visible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to say that here existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days, nor radiant ky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-hole daylight habitually llumined his soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.38#To sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translated into ositive results in all that we have just pointed out, we will confine ourselves o the statement that, in the course of nineteen years, Jean Valjean, the noffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the formidable convict of Toulon, had ecome capable, thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him, of wo sorts of evil action: firstly, of evil action which was rapid, npremeditated, dashing, entirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for he evil which he had undergone; secondly, of evil action which was serious, rave, consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which such misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed through three successive hases, which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse,—reasoning, will, erseverance. He had for moving causes his habitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a rofound sense of indignities suffered, the reaction even against the good, the nnocent, and the just, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the oint of arrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatred hich, if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident, ecomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, then the hatred of the uman race, then the hatred of creation, and which manifests itself by a vague, ncessant, and brutal desire to do harm to some living being, no matter whom. It ill be perceived that it was not without reason that Jean Valjean’s passport escribed him as _a very dangerous man_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.7.39#From year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal ureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from the alleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.

The desperate man gives p; he is weary, he chooses the alternative of death; he resists not; he lets imself go; he abandons his grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the ugubrious dreary depths of engulfment.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.9.1#When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when ean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, _Thou art free!_ the moment eemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true ight of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it was not long before his ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty. He had elieved in a new life. He very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to hich a yellow passport is provided.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.9.2#And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that his arnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a hundred and eventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in is calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen ears, which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs. At all events, his oard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and ine francs fifteen sous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He ad understood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say the ord—robbed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.9.3#On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an range-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He offered his ervices. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work. He was ntelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master seemed pleased. While e was at work, a gendarme passed, observed him, and demanded his papers. It was ecessary to show him the yellow passport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his abor. A little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the mount which they earned each day at this occupation; he had been told _thirty ous_. When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following ay, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be aid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous. He objected. e was told, _“That is enough for thee.”_ He persisted. The master looked him traight between the eyes, and said to him _“Beware of the prison.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.9.4#There, again, he considered that he had been robbed.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.1#As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.2#What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years ince he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the sensation as too novel not to disturb his slumbers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.3#He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He was ccustomed not to devote many hours to repose.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.4#He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then he losed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.5#When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters reoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time. Sleep comes ore easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean Valjean. He could not et to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.6#He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one’s ind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His memories f the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and ingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming disproportionately arge, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and perturbed pool. Many houghts occurred to him; but there was one which kept constantly presenting tself afresh, and which drove away all others. We will mention this thought at nce: he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle hich Madame Magloire had placed on the table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.7#Those six sets of silver haunted him.—They were there.—A few paces istant.—Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which e then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act of placing them in a ittle cupboard near the head of the bed.—He had taken careful note of this upboard.—On the right, as you entered from the dining-room.—They were olid.—And old silver.—From the ladle one could get at least two hundred rancs.—Double what he had earned in nineteen years.—It is true that he would ave earned more if “the _administration_ had not _robbed him_.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.8#His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was ertainly mingled some struggle. Three o’clock struck. He opened his eyes again, rew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched out his arm and felt f his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove; then he ung his legs over the edge of the bed, and placed his feet on the floor, and hus found himself, almost without knowing it, seated on his bed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.9#He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have been uggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark, he only person awake in that house where all were sleeping. All of a sudden he tooped down, removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the ed; then he resumed his thoughtful attitude, and became motionless once ore.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.10#Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above ndicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew, re-entered, nd in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also, without knowing why, nd with the mechanical persistence of reverie, of a convict named Brevet, whom e had known in the galleys, and whose trousers had been upheld by a single uspender of knitted cotton. The checkered pattern of that suspender recurred ncessantly to his mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.11#He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely, ven until daybreak, had not the clock struck one—the half or quarter hour. It eemed to him that that stroke said to him, “Come on!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.12#He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all was uiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, to the indow, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark; there was a ull moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, utdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings f the clouds; and indoors a sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to nable a person to see his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled he sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before hich the passers-by come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean xamined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, ccording to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but s a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it gain immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which tudies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white all, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, paced at regular intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden rom an avenue or lane planted with trees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.13#Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who as made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, opened it, umbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed, put his hoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up again, threw the knapsack n his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the visor down over his eyes, felt for is cudgel, went and placed it in the angle of the window; then returned to the ed, and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there. It resembled short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been ifficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron ould have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.14#In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more han a miner’s candlestick. Convicts were, at that period, sometimes employed in uarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, and it was not rare or them to have miners’ tools at their command. These miners’ candlesticks are f massive iron, terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which hey are stuck into the rock.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.15#He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and trying o deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of the djoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.10.16#On arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closed t.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.head#CHAPTER XI—WHAT HE DOES
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.1#Jean Valjean listened. Not a sound.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.2#He gave the door a push.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.3#He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the furtive nd uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.4#The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent ovement, which enlarged the opening a little.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.5#He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.6#It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough to allow im to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, which formed an mbarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.7#Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost, to nlarge the aperture still further.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.8#He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, more nergetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted mid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.9#Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with omething of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day of udgment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.10#In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that hat hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a terrible life, nd that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one, and warn and to wake hose who were asleep. He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fell back from the ips of his toes upon his heels. He heard the arteries in his temples beating ike two forge hammers, and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his reast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to im that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed he entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by him, ad taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at once; the two ld women would shriek out; people would come to their assistance; in less than quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar, and the gendarmerie on and. For a moment he thought himself lost.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.11#He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring to ake a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide open. He entured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there. He lent an ear. othing was moving in the house. The noise made by the rusty hinge had not wakened any one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.12#This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult ithin him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought himself ost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish as soon as ossible. He took a step and entered the room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.13#This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and onfused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers scattered n a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an armchair heaped with lothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and hitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced with precaution, taking care not to knock gainst the furniture. He could hear, at the extremity of the room, the even and ranquil breathing of the sleeping Bishop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.14#He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there ooner than he had thought for.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.15#Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions ith sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she desired to make us eflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens. At the oment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed, this cloud parted, as hough on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing the long window, suddenly lluminated the Bishop’s pale face. He was sleeping peacefully. He lay in his ed almost completely dressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a arment of brown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown ack on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with he pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy ctions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face was illumined with vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and of felicity. It was more than a mile, and almost a radiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection f a light which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a ysterious heaven.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.16#A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.17#It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was ithin him. That heaven was his conscience.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.18#At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak, pon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It emained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That moon in he sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, that house which as so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added some solemn and nspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man, and enveloped in a sort f serene and majestic aureole that white hair, those closed eyes, that face in hich all was hope and all was confidence, that head of an old man, and that lumber of an infant.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.19#There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august, ithout being himself aware of it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.20#Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron andlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had he eheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The moral world has no rander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasy conscience, which has arrived n the brink of an evil action, contemplating the slumber of the just.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.21#That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, had bout it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiously onscious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.22#No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself. In rder to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of the most iolent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on his visage it ould have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty. It was a sort f haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and that was all. But what was his hought? It would have been impossible to divine it. What was evident was, that e was touched and astounded. But what was the nature of this emotion?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.23#His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to be nferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision. One ould have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses,—the one in which ne loses one’s self and that in which one saves one’s self. He seemed prepared o crush that skull or to kiss that hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.24#At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his row, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same eliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap in his left and, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all over his savage ead.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.25#The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying aze.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.26#The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the himney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them, with a enediction for one and pardon for the other.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.11.27#Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidly ast the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard, which he aw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though to force the lock; he key was there; he opened it; the first thing which presented itself to him as the basket of silverware; he seized it, traversed the chamber with long trides, without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the oise, gained the door, re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his udgel, bestrode the window-sill of the ground floor, put the silver into his napsack, threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a iger, and fled.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.48#He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and rought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering a word, ithout a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the Bishop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.49#Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks echanically, and with a bewildered air.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.50#“Now,” said the Bishop, “go in peace. By the way, when you return, my riend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and epart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, ither by day or by night.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.55#The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.56#“Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money in ecoming an honest man.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.57#Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything, emained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them. e resumed with solemnity:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.12.58#“Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It s your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the pirit of perdition, and I give it to God.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.head#CHAPTER XIII—LITTLE GERVAIS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.1#Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set out at very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths presented hemselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his teps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without having eaten anything and ithout feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng of novel sensations. He was onscious of a sort of rage; he did not know against whom it was directed. He ould not have told whether he was touched or humiliated. There came over him at oments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness cquired during the last twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued im. He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the njustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him. He sked himself what would replace this. At times he would have actually preferred o be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in his way; it would have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far dvanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, hose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of is childhood. These memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long ince they had recurred to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.2#Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.3#As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the soil rom every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain, hich was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the horizon except the Alps. ot even the spire of a distant village. Jean Valjean might have been three eagues distant from D—— A path which intersected the plain passed a few paces rom the bush.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.4#In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not a little o render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him, a oyous sound became audible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.5#He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age, oming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his marmot-box n his back.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.6#One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affording a iew of their knees through the holes in their trousers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.7#Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to time, nd played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand—his whole ortune, probably.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.8#Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.9#The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and ossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught with a good eal of adroitness on the back of his hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.10#This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the rushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.11#Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.12#In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight f him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.13#He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.14#The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was ot a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny, feeble ries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the heavens at an mmense height. The child was standing with his back to the sun, which cast hreads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its blood-red gleam the savage ace of Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.15#“Sir,” said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is omposed of ignorance and innocence, “my money.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.16#“What is your name?” said Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.17#“Little Gervais, sir.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.18#“Go away,” said Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.19#“Sir,” resumed the child, “give me back my money.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.20#Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.21#The child began again, “My money, sir.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.22#Jean Valjean’s eyes remained fixed on the earth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.23#“My piece of money!” cried the child, “my white piece! my silver!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.24#It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped him y the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made an effort to isplace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.25#“I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.26#The child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated. is eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement, then he tretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice, “Who’s here?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.27#“I, sir,” replied the child. “Little Gervais! I! Give me back my forty ous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.28#Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.29#“Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we’ll ee!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.30#“Ah! It’s still you!” said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his feet, is foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.31#“Will you take yourself off!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.32#The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to oot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top of his peed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.33#Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance, nd Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own reverie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.34#At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.35#The sun had set.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.36#The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing all ay; it is probable that he was feverish.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.37#He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the hild’s flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals. His aze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed to be scrutinizing with rofound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which ad fallen in the grass. All at once he shivered; he had just begun to feel the hill of evening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.38#He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to cross nd button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.39#At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot had alf ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles. It was as hough he had received a galvanic shock. “What is this?” he muttered between his eeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted, without being able to detach his aze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before, as though he thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted pon him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.40#At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the ilver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar ff over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the orizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like a terrified wild animal hich is seeking refuge.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.41#He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great anks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.42#He said, “Ah!” and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had isappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him and saw othing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.43#Then he shouted with all his might:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.44#“Little Gervais! Little Gervais!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.45#He paused and waited.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.46#There was no reply.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.47#The landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space. There as nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost, and a ilence which engulfed his voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.48#An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort of ugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury. ne would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.49#He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to time e halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was the most ormidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear, “Little ervais! Little Gervais!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.50#Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and ould have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no doubt lready far away.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.51#He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.52#“Monsieur le Curé, have you seen a child pass?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.53#“No,” said the priest.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.55#“I have seen no one.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.56#He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the riest.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.57#“Monsieur le Curé, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Curé, he was little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a hurdy-gurdy. ne of those Savoyards, you know?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.58#“I have not seen him.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.59#“Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.60#“If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Such ersons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.61#Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence, and ave them to the priest.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.62#“For your poor,” he said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.63#Then he added, wildly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.64#“Monsieur l’Abbé, have me arrested. I am a thief.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.65#The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.66#Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first aken.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.67#In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling, houting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain towards omething which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or rouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a evel with the earth. At length, at a spot where three paths intersected each ther, he stopped. The moon had risen. He sent his gaze into the distance and houted for the last time, “Little Gervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!” His hout died away in the mist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet nce more, “Little Gervais!” but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It as his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an nvisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil onscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair nd his face on his knees, and he cried, “I am a wretch!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.68#Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that he ad wept in nineteen years.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.69#When Jean Valjean left the Bishop’s house, he was, as we have seen, quite hrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He could not yield o the evidence of what was going on within him. He hardened himself against the ngelic action and the gentle words of the old man. “You have promised me to ecome an honest man. I buy your soul. I take it away from the spirit of erversity; I give it to the good God.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.70#This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness he pposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was indistinctly onscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most ormidable attack which had moved him yet; that his obduracy was finally settled f he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he should be obliged to enounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul hrough so many years, and which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to onquer or to be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, ad been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.71#In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is ntoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct erception of what might result to him from his adventure at D——? Did he nderstand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at ertain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed he solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained a middle course or him; that if he were not henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; hat it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall ower than the convict; that if he wished to become good he must become an ngel; that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.72#Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to urselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a onfused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does form the education of he intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a ondition to disentangle all that we have here indicated. If these ideas ccurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather than saw them, and they only ucceeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of motion. On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the alleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his yes on emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered tself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors and nxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, who should suddenly ee the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by irtue.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.73#That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no onger the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was no onger in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to him and ad not touched him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.74#In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed im of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it; was this he last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evil thoughts which e had brought away from the galleys,—a remnant of impulse, a result of what is alled in statics, _acquired force?_ It was that, and it was also, perhaps, even ess than that. Let us say it simply, it was not he who stole; it was not the an; it was the beast, who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot pon that money, while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and itherto unheard-of thoughts besetting it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.75#When intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean aljean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.76#It was because,—strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in the ituation in which he found himself,—in stealing the money from that child, he ad done a thing of which he was no longer capable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.77#However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on him; t abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and dispersed it, laced on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other the light, and acted on is soul, in the state in which it then was, as certain chemical reagents act pon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the ther.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.78#First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all ewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the child in rder to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the fact that this as impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when he exclaimed “I am a retch!” he had just perceived what he was, and he was already separated from imself to such a degree, that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything ore than a phantom, and as if he had, there before him, in flesh and blood, the ideous galley-convict, Jean Valjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, is knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and loomy visage, with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.79#Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort a isionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw that Jean aljean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reached the point of sking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.80#His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm oments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no longer eholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as though apart from ne’s self, the figures which one has in one’s own mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.81#Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the same ime, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of ight which he at first took for a torch. On scrutinizing this light which ppeared to his conscience with more attention, he recognized the fact that it ossessed a human form and that this torch was the Bishop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.82#His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,—the ishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to soften the econd. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar to this sort of cstasies, in proportion as his reverie continued, as the Bishop grew great and esplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean grow less and vanish. After a ertain time he was no longer anything more than a shade. All at once he isappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he filled the whole soul of this retched man with a magnificent radiance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.83#Jean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed with ore weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.84#As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an xtraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past life, his irst fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, his internal ardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance, hat had happened to him at the Bishop’s, the last thing that he had done, that heft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the more cowardly, and all the ore monstrous since it had come after the Bishop’s pardon,—all this recurred to is mind and appeared clearly to him, but with a clearness which he had never itherto witnessed. He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his oul, and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over his life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light of aradise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.2.13.85#How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept? Whither id he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be authenticated is hat that same night the carrier who served Grenoble at that epoch, and who rrived at D—— about three o’clock in the morning, saw, as he traversed the treet in which the Bishop’s residence was situated, a man in the attitude of rayer, kneeling on the pavement in the shadow, in front of the door of onseigneur Welcome.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.3.1.head#CHAPTER I—THE YEAR 1817
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.3.1.1#1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance which as not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is the ear in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was celebrated. All the hairdressers’ hops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird, were besmeared with zure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candid time at which Count Lynch at every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden’s pew of aint-Germain-des-Prés, in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon nd his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being ayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a ittle too promptly to M. the Duke d’Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817 ashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps f morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army as dressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called egions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at t. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old oats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier eigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There ere still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy had just sserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, of arbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and he Abbé Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked at each ther, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 4th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had aid it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in he side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might ave been seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with races of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were the olumns which two years before had upheld the Emperor’s platform in the Champ de ai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the bivouac of ustrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had isappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the mperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been eld in the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, wo things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box _à la Charter_. he most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his rother’s head into the fountain of the Flower-Market.

Colonel Selves was going to gypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, erved as a shop for a cooper. On the platform of the octagonal tower of the otel de Cluny, the little shed of boards, which had served as an observatory to essier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The uchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished _Ourika_, in her oudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N’s were scratched off the ouvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of he King’s Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the ridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., uch preoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, eroes who have become emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who have become auphins, had two anxieties,—Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy ad given for its prize subject, _The Happiness procured through Study_. M. ellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be seen germinating that uture advocate-general of Broë, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis ourier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until here should be a false Marchangy, named d’Arlincourt. _Claire d’Albe_ and Malek-Adel_ were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of he epoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from ts list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angoulême into a naval school; or the Duc d’Angoulême, being lord high admiral, it was evident that the city f Angoulême had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical rinciple would have received a wound. In the Council of Ministers the question as agitated whether vignettes representing slack-rope performances, which dorned Franconi’s advertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street rchins, should be tolerated. M. Paër, the author of _Agnese_, a good sort of ellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little private oncerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l‘Évêque. All the young irls were singing the _Hermit of Saint-Avelle_, with words by Edmond Géraud. The Yellow Dwarf_ was transferred into _Mirror_. The Café Lemblin stood up for he Emperor, against the Café Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de erri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a rincess of Sicily. Madame de Staël had died a year previously. The body-guard issed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers were all very small. Their form as restricted, but their liberty was great. The _Constitutionnel_ was onstitutional. _La Minerve_ called Chateaubriand _Chateaubriant_. That _t_ made he good middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer. n journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles f 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot as no longer honest, Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no onger any genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile y post very rarely reached him, as the police made it their religious duty to ntercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. ow David, having, in a Belgian publication, shown some displeasure at not eceiving letters which had been written to him, it struck the royalist journals s amusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What eparated two men more than an abyss was to say, the _regicides_, or to say the voters_; to say the _enemies_, or to say the _allies_; to say _Napoleon_, or to ay _Buonaparte_. All sensible people were agreed that the era of revolution had een closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed “The Immortal Author of the harter.” On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word _Redivivus_ was carved on he pedestal that awaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Thérèse, o. 4, was making the rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the onarchy. The leaders of the Right said at grave conjunctures, “We must write to acot.” MM. Canuel, O’Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, o some extent with Monsieur’s approval, of what was to become later on “The onspiracy of the Bord de l‘Eau”—of the waterside. L‘Épingle Noire was already lotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring with Trogoff. M. ecazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood every morning t his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and lippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed n a mirror, a complete set of dentist’s instruments spread out before him, leaning his teeth, which were charming, while he dictated _The Monarchy ccording to the Charter_ to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an uthoritative tone, preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Féletez signed himself A.; . Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote _Thérèse Aubert_. Divorce was bolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decorated on the ollar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other _apropos_ of the King of ome. The counter-police of the château had denounced to her Royal Highness adame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d’Orléans, who made a etter appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc e Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons—a serious inconvenience. he city of Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own xpense. Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such r such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M. lausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedian Picard, ho belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Molière had not been able to do, ad _The Two Philiberts_ played at the Odéon, upon whose pediment the removal of he letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took art for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was evolutionary. The Liberal, Pélicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the ollowing title: _Works of Voltaire_, of the French Academy. “That will attract urchasers,” said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M. Charles oyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him—a ign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:—

The quarrel over the valley of Dappes was egun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain, afterwards eneral Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his sublime dream. There was celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science, whom posterity has forgotten; nd in some garret an obscure Fourier, whom the future will recall. Lord Byron as beginning to make his mark; a note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to rance in these terms: _a certain Lord Baron_. David d’Angers was trying to work n marble. The Abbé Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private athering of seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown riest, named Félicité-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thing hich smoked and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dog went nd came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont ouis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was not good for much; a sort of laything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia—a steamboat. The arisians stared indifferently at this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the eformer of the Institute by a coup d‘état, the distinguished author of numerous cademicians, ordinances, and batches of members, after having created them, ould not succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the avilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on account f his piety. Dupuytren and Récamier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre f the School of Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists on the ubject of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

Traitors howed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the enemy on the eve of attle made no secret of their recompense, and strutted immodestly in the light f day, in the cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and uatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited their evotion to the monarchy in the most barefaced manner.

They were four Oscars; for, at that epoch, Arthurs did ot yet exist. _Burn for him the perfumes of Araby!_ exclaimed romance. _Oscar dvances. Oscar, I shall behold him!_ People had just emerged from Ossian; legance was Scandinavian and Caledonian; the pure English style was only to revail later, and the first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the attle of Waterloo.

Naturally, each of them had his mistress. Blachevelle oved Favourite, so named because she had been in England; Listolier adored ahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower; Fameuil idolized éphine, an abridgment of Joséphine; Tholomyès had Fantine, called the Blonde, ecause of her beautiful, sunny hair.

One of the four as called the young, because she was the youngest of them, and one was called he old; the old one was twenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first ere more experienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of ife than Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.

Poverty and oquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds and the other flatters, and the eautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear, ach on its own side. These badly guarded souls listen. Hence the falls which hey accomplish, and the stones which are thrown at them. They are overwhelmed ith splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the ungfrau were hungry?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.3.2.6#Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zéphine. She ad had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was an old nmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart, who went out to ive lessons in spite of his age. This professor, when he was a young man, had ne day seen a chambermaid’s gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in onsequence of this accident. The result had been Favourite. She met her father rom time to time, and he bowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of devotee, had entered her apartments, and had said to her, “You do not know me, amemoiselle?” “No.” “I am your mother.” Then the old woman opened the ideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned brought in, and nstalled herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke to Favourite, emained hours without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, nd went down to the porter’s quarters for company, where she spoke ill of her aughter.

She received he name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. he was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature ad entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town nd went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came o Paris “to seek her fortune.” Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long s she could. She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth.

Tholomyès was a fast man of thirty, and badly preserved. He as wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a bald spot, of which he imself said with sadness, _the skull at thirty, the knee at forty_. His igestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye. But n proportion as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his eeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping ye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated but still in flower. His youth, hich was packing up for departure long before its time, beat a retreat in good rder, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had a iece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In addition o this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is a vast force in the yes of the weak. Being thus ironical and bald, he was the leader. _Iron_ is an nglish word. Is it possible that irony is derived from it?

Then they went to Saint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade nd exclaimed, “This must be very beautiful when there is water!” They reakfasted at the _Tête-Noir_, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated hemselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand ountain; they ascended Diogenes’ lantern, they gambled for macaroons at the oulette establishment of the Pont de Sèvres, picked bouquets at Pateaux, bought eed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, and were perfectly happy.

Favourite, Blachevelle’s friend, the one aged three and twenty, the ld one, ran on in front under the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, talked distractedly over bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the pirit of a young female faun. Zéphine and Dahlia, whom chance had made eautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together, and ompleted each other, never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry han from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; he first _keepsakes_ had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning for omen, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the tender sex egan to droop dolefully.

Although she would have refused othing to Tholomyès, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, her ace in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almost austere ignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there was nothing more ingular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there, and editation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state. This sudden and ometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her row, her nose, her chin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite istinct from equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance esults; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the ose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming fold, a ysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana ound in the treasures of Iconia.

These passages of happy couples are a profound appeal o life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth from everything. here was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in ove,—in that eternal hedge-school of lovers, which is forever beginning anew, nd which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars. Hence the opularity of spring among thinkers. The patrician and the knife-grinder, the uke and the peer, the limb of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they sed to say in olden times, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, nd there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis—what a transfiguration ffected by love! Notaries’ clerks are gods. And the little cries, the pursuits hrough the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those jargons which are elodies, those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a yllable, those cherries torn from one mouth by another,—all this blazes forth nd takes its place among the celestial glories. Beautiful women waste hemselves sweetly. They think that this will never come to an end. hilosophers, poets, painters, observe these ecstasies and know not what to make f it, so greatly are they dazzled by it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims atteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have litted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these ove idyls, and d’Urfé mingles druids with them.

There was always an admiring crowd about it.

At Issy an incident occurred. The truly national park, at that ime owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened to be wide open. They passed the ates, visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto, tried the mysterious little ffects of the famous cabinet of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr ecome a millionaire or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had toutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the bbé de Bernis. As he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing folds n the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid peals f laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyès, who was somewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse eing the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the old ballad gallega_, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a ope between two trees:—

The horses of Marly, hose neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud of gold. Carriages were going nd coming. A squadron of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions at their ead, were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly osy in the setting sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la oncorde, which had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy romenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ibbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817. ere and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds, amid the passers-by, ho formed into circles and applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which as destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its efrain:—

Everything was radiant. It was a time of ndisputed peace and profound royalist security; it was the epoch when a special nd private report of Chief of Police Anglès to the King, on the subject of the uburbs of Paris, terminated with these lines:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.3.5.10#“Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be feared rom these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. The populace is estless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are very pretty men, Sire. t would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers. There is othing to be feared on the part of the populace of Paris the capital. It is emarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the ast fifty years; and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the ime of the Revolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable abble.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.3.5.11#Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform tself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the miracle rought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised by Count Anglès ossessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their eyes it was liberty ncarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the iræus, there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure f a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris n too “rose-colored” a light; it is not so much of “an amiable rabble” as it is hought. The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no ne sleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than e, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be trusted evertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there is glory at he end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury. Give him a ike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you will have usterlitz. He is Napoleon’s stay and Danton’s resource. Is it a question of ountry, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears up the pavements. eware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the olds of a chlamys. Take care! he will make of the first Rue Grenétat which omes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs ill grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, nd his breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from that lender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is, thanks to he suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers urope. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you ill see! As long as he has for refrain nothing but _la Carmagnole_, he only verthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the _Marseillaise_, and he will free the orld.

The pun is the dung of the mind hich soars. The jest falls, no matter where; and the mind after producing a iece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths. A whitish speck flattened gainst the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from e to insult the pun! I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All he most august, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps utside of humanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses n Isaac, Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that leopatra’s pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been for it, o one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name which signifies a adle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I epeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or lays on words. Listen to me.

Even in the matter of turnovers, good ense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the glutton, _Gula punit Gulax_. ndigestion is charged by the good God with preaching morality to stomachs. And emember this: each one of our passions, even love, has a stomach which must not e filled too full. In all things the word _finis_ must be written in good eason; self-control must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt ust be drawn on appetite; one must set one’s own fantasy to the violin, and arry one’s self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given oment, to effect his own arrest.

Long live that Tzar who was great, nd long live his boot, which was still greater! Ladies, take the advice of a riend; make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit. The property of love is o err. A love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an nglish serving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not ade for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error is human; say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zéphine, O Joséphine, face ore than irregular, you would be charming were you not all askew. You have the ir of a pretty face upon which some one has sat down by mistake. As for avourite, O nymphs and muses! one day when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter n the Rue Guérin-Boisseau, he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well rawn up, which displayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle ell in love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionian ips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the painter of he lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint thy mouth. Listen! efore thee, there was never a creature worthy of the name. Thou wert made to eceive the apple like Venus, or to eat it like Eve; beauty begins with thee. I ave just referred to Eve; it is thou who hast created her. Thou deservest the etters-patent of the beautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as thou,’ because I pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a ittle while ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust ames. They may delude us. I am called Félix, and I am not happy. Words are iars. Let us not blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would e a mistake to write to Liège 2 for corks, and to Pau for gloves. Miss Dahlia, ere I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A flower should smell sweet, and oman should have wit. I say nothing of Fantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, houghtful, pensive person; she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph nd the modesty of a nun, who has strayed into the life of a grisette, but who akes refuge in illusions, and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure ithout very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her yes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in xistence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyès, I am an illusion; but she does ot even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest, everything about er is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light. O Fantine, maid worthy of eing called Marguerite or Pearl, you are a woman from the beauteous Orient. adies, a second piece of advice: do not marry; marriage is a graft; it takes ell or ill; avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. irls are incurable on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say ill not prevent the waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming of usbands studded with diamonds. Well, so be it; but, my beauties, remember this, ou eat too much sugar. You have but one fault, O woman, and that is nibbling ugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. Now, heed me ell, sugar is a salt. All salts are withering. Sugar is the most desiccating of ll salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins; hence the oagulation, and then the solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the ungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders on consumption. Then, do not runch sugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest, ob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across. In love here are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is pen. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is a _casus belli_; a pretty oman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined y petticoats. Woman is man’s right. Romulus carried off the Sabines; William arried off the Saxon women; Cæsar carried off the Roman women. The man who is ot loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own art, to all those unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime roclamation of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: “Soldiers, you are in need of verything; the enemy has it.”

There are still human beings here below who know how to pen and close the surprise box of the paradox merrily. This, ladies, which you re drinking with so tranquil an air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the ineyard of Coural das Freiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms bove the level of the sea.

Alas! always the same, and nothing new; nothing more npublished by the creator in creation! _Nil sub sole novum_, says Solomon; amor omnibus idem_, says Virgil; and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark t Saint-Cloud, as Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One ast word. Do you know what Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an epoch hen women had, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy and purple ue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia was a creature n whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess prostitute; Socrates lus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a mistress should be needed for rometheus.”

The shock caused the art and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a Beauceron mare, old and hin, and one fit for the knacker, which was dragging a very heavy cart. On rriving in front of Bombarda’s, the worn-out, exhausted beast had refused to roceed any further. This incident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and ndignant carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, Mâtin_ (the jade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade ell, never to rise again.

From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow and black, eavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by trunks, tarpaulins, and alises, full of heads which immediately disappeared, rushed through the crowd ith all the sparks of a forge, with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, rinding the pavements, changing all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar elighted the young girls. Favourite exclaimed:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.3.9.10#It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with ifficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out again at a allop. This surprised Fantine.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.1#There was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this entury, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop was kept by ome people named Thénardier, husband and wife. It was situated in Boulanger ane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall. Upon this oard was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his ack, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general, with large silver tars; red spots represented blood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, nd probably represented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF ERGEANT OF WATERLOO (_Au Sargent de Waterloo_).
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.2#Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry. evertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment of a ehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the _Sergeant f Waterloo_, one evening in the spring of 1818, would certainly have attracted, y its mass, the attention of any painter who had passed that way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.3#It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded racts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of rees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot, nto which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which was supported by two huge wheels. he whole thing was compact, overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the un-carriage of an enormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the heels, the fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous ellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond of rnamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the iron eneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of ome Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the beams, which it was its ffice to transport, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served o harness; it had the air of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman alleys, and it seemed to have been detached from some monster. Homer would have ound Polyphemus with it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.4#Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In the irst place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might finish the rocess of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the old social order, hich one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors, and which ave no other reasons for existence than the above.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.5#The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and in he loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, on that articular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little girls; one about two ears and a half old, the other, eighteen months; the younger in the arms of the ther. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted about them, prevented their falling out. mother had caught sight of that frightful chain, and had said, “Come! there’s plaything for my children.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.6#The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance, were adiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amid old ron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full of laughter. One ad chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faces were two delighted urprises; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes hich seemed to emanate from them; the child of eighteen months displayed her retty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood. Above and round these two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the igantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all entangled in urves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few aces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the mother, not very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching at that moment, was winging the two children by means of a long cord, watching them carefully, for ear of accidents, with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar o maternity. At every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a trident sound, which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in cstasies; the setting sun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be more harming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the wing of cherubim.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.16#This woman’s child was one of the most divine creatures that it is ossible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She could have ntered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as the coquetry f her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen, ribbons on her bodice, nd Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of her skirt were raised so as to ermit a view of her white, firm, and dimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and ealthy. The little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of er cheeks. Of her eyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very arge, and that they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.

Perhaps; but in that attire it was not apparent. er hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed very thick, but was everely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close, nun-like cap, tied under the hin. A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them; but she did not smile. er eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time. She was pale; she ad a very weary and rather sickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter sleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own hild. A large blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a ichu, and concealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted ith freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle; she ore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, and coarse shoes.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.19#It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on scrutinizing er attentively, it was evident that she still retained her beauty. A melancholy old, which resembled the beginning of irony, wrinkled her right cheek. As for er toilette, that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons, which seemed made of irth, of folly, and of music, full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had anished like that beautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for iamonds in the sunlight; it melts and leaves the branch quite black.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.1.22#After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately ost sight of Favourite, Zéphine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the side of he men, it was loosed between the women; they would have been greatly stonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they had been friends; here no longer existed any reason for such a thing. Fantine had remained alone. he father of her child gone,—alas! such ruptures are irrevocable,—she found erself absolutely isolated, minus the habit of work and plus the taste for leasure. Drawn away by her _liaison_ with Tholomyès to disdain the pretty trade hich she knew, she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to er. She had no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how o write; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name; she had a ublic letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyès, then a second, then a hird. Tholomyès replied to none of them. Fantine heard the gossips say, as they ooked at her child: “Who takes those children seriously! One only shrugs one’s houlders over such children!” Then she thought of Tholomyès, who had shrugged is shoulders over his child, and who did not take that innocent being eriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. But what was she to do? he no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committed a fault, but the oundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was modesty and virtue. She was aguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, and of liding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; she possessed it, and held erself firm. The idea of returning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to er. There, some one might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it ould be necessary to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the ecessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one. Her eart contracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the ierce bravery of life. She had already valiantly renounced finery, had dressed erself in linen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, nd all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left to her, and a oly one it was. She sold all that she had, which produced for her two hundred rancs; her little debts paid, she had only about eighty francs left. At the age f twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning, she quitted Paris, bearing her hild on her back. Any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on hem. This woman had, in all the world, nothing but her child, and the child ad, in all the world, no one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and his had tired her chest, and she coughed a little.

She was simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances produce that effect when ubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman. She was still young; she was arely thirty. If this crouching woman had stood upright, her lofty stature and er frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened he traveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed what caused hat we have to relate to vanish.

The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother’s, and looked t—what? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children, hich is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight f virtue. One would say that they feel themselves to be angels, and that they now us to be men. Then the child began to laugh; and although the mother held ast to her, she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little eing which wished to run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the wing, stopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign of admiration.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.3#Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later n.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.4#These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who ave been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale, hich is between the class called “middle” and the class denominated as inferior,” and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all he vices of the first, without possessing the generous impulse of the orkingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.5#They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warm hem up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum of the rute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both were susceptible, in he highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the irection of evil. There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating owards the darkness, retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing xperience to augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming ore and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and woman ossessed such souls.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.6#Thénardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can nly look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are dark in both irections. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front. There is omething of the unknown about them. One can no more answer for what they have one than for what they will do. The shadow which they bear in their glance enounces them. From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a esture, one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre ysteries in their future.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.7#This Thénardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier—a ergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, and had ven conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We shall see later n how much truth there was in this. The sign of his hostelry was in allusion to ne of his feats of arms. He had painted it himself; for he knew how to do a ittle of everything, and badly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.8#It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having een _Clélie_, was no longer anything but _Lodoïska_, still noble, but ever more nd more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scudéri to Madame ournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthélemy-Hadot, was etting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging he suburbs to some extent. Madame Thénardier was just intelligent enough to ead this sort of books. She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she ossessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort f pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian ettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, ut, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of igault-Lebrun, and “in what concerns the sex,” as he said in his jargon—a ownright, unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than e was. Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, egan to grow gray, when the Megæra began to be developed from the Pamela, the emale Thénardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in tupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was hat her eldest daughter was named Éponine; as for the younger, the poor little hing came near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effected by romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of zelma.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.2.9#However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and uperficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which may be esignated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of this romantic lement which we have just indicated there is the social symptom. It is not rare or the neatherd’s boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, nd for the vicomte—if there are still any vicomtes—to be called Thomas, Pierre, r Jacques. This displacement, which places the “elegant” name on the plebeian nd the rustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality. he irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else. eneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing,—the French evolution.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.3.2#Thanks to the traveller’s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been able to void a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month they were gain in need of money. The woman took Cosette’s outfit to Paris, and pawned it t the pawnbroker’s for sixty francs. As soon as that sum was spent, the hénardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom hey were caring for out of charity; and they treated her accordingly. As she ad no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and hemises of the Thénardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what ll the rest had left—a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat. oreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate ith them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.3.3#The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M. ur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter every month, hat she might have news of her child. The Thénardiers replied invariably, Cosette is doing wonderfully well.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.3.4#At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for he seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from onth to month. The year was not completed when Thénardier said: “A fine favor he is doing us, in sooth! What does she expect us to do with her seven francs?” nd he wrote to demand twelve francs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into he belief that her child was happy, “and was coming on well,” submitted, and orwarded the twelve francs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.3.5#Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other. other Thénardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused her to hate he stranger.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.4.3.6#It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous spects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her as though t were taken from her own, and that that little child diminished the air which er daughters breathed. This woman, like many women of her sort, had a load of aresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day. If she had not ad Cosette, it is certain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have eceived the whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the lows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could not ake a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent lows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, who should not have nderstood anything of this world or of God, incessantly punished, scolded, ll-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself, who ived in a ray of dawn!

This industry ad always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw material, which eacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M., an nheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of “black goods.” owards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger, had established himself in the own, and had been inspired with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, um-lac for resin, and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply aid together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.

M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this branch of commerce. ather Madeleine’s profits were such, that at the end of the second year he was ble to erect a large factory, in which there were two vast workrooms, one for he men, and the other for women. Any one who was hungry could present himself here, and was sure of finding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required f the men good will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had eparated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women nd girls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was the nly thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the more firmly et on this severity, since M. sur M., being a garrison town, opportunities for orruption abounded. However, his coming had been a boon, and his presence was a odsend. Before Father Madeleine’s arrival, everything had languished in the ountry; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil. A strong circulation armed everything and penetrated everywhere. Slack seasons and wretchedness were nknown. There was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it; no welling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.

He ppeared to be thinking much of others, and little of himself. In 1820 he was nown to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name ith Laffitte; but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand rancs, he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor.

The lower town, in which he lived, ad but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to ruin: he constructed wo, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted a salary from his own funds o the two instructors, a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary, nd one day he said to some one who expressed surprise, “The two prime unctionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster.” He created at is own expense an infant school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a und for aiding old and infirm workmen.

He went regularly to low mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed ut all rivalry everywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This eputy had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the eligious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of Fouché, Duc ’Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He indulged in gentle raillery t God with closed doors. But when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine oing to low mass at seven o’clock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, nd resolved to outdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and o vespers. Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a ace to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, or the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made welve.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.4.3#Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact, ne of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth, where othing is complete. To have continually at one’s side a woman, a daughter, a ister, a charming being, who is there because you need her and because she annot do without you; to know that we are indispensable to a person who is ecessary to us; to be able to incessantly measure one’s affection by the amount f her presence which she bestows on us, and to say to ourselves, “Since she onsecrates the whole of her time to me, it is because I possess the whole of er heart”; to behold her thought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify the idelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a own as the sound of wings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return, ing, and to think that one is the centre of these steps, of this speech; to anifest at each instant one’s personal attraction; to feel one’s self all the ore powerful because of one’s infirmity; to become in one’s obscurity, and hrough one’s obscurity, the star around which this angel gravitates,—few elicities equal this. The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction hat one is loved; loved for one’s own sake—let us say rather, loved in spite of ne’s self; this conviction the blind man possesses. To be served in distress is o be caressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight when one as love. And what love! A love wholly constituted of virtue! There is no lindness where there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it. nd this soul, found and tested, is a woman. A hand sustains you; it is hers: a outh lightly touches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear a breath very near ou; it is hers. To have everything of her, from her worship to her pity, never o be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that immovable eed, to touch Providence with one’s hands, and to be able to take it in one’s rms,—God made tangible,—what bliss! The heart, that obscure, celestial flower, ndergoes a mysterious blossoming. One would not exchange that shadow for all rightness! The angel soul is there, uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it s but to return again; she vanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. ne feels warmth approaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with erenity, with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there re a thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in that void. The most neffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, and supplying the anished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul. One sees nothing, but ne feels that one is adored. It is a paradise of shadows.

On the one hand, he said, “The functionary can make no istake; the magistrate is never the wrong.” On the other hand, he said, “These en are irremediably lost. Nothing good can come from them.” He fully shared the pinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law I know not what ower of making, or, if the reader will have it so, of authenticating, demons, nd who place a Styx at the base of society. He was stoical, serious, austere; a elancholy dreamer, humble and haughty, like fanatics. His glance was like a imlet, cold and piercing. His whole life hung on these two words: watchfulness nd supervision. He had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked hing in the world; he possessed the conscience of his usefulness, the religion f his functions, and he was a spy as other men are priests.

And he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which s conferred by virtue. And, withal, a life of privation, isolation, abnegation, hastity, with never a diversion.

But hen the occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to emerge from all his shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular forehead, a baleful lance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and a monstrous cudgel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.20#In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, although he ated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This could be ecognized by some emphasis in his speech.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.21#As we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself, he ermitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection with umanity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.22#The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the error of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry of ustice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert routed them by ts mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at sight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.23#Such was this formidable man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.24#Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full of uspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact; but it eemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put a question to Javert; e neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that embarrassing and almost ppressive gaze without appearing to notice it. He treated Javert with ease and ourtesy, as he did all the rest of the world.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.25#It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had secretly nvestigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race, and into which here enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior traces which Father adeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to know, and he sometimes said in overt words, that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain istrict about a family which had disappeared. Once he chanced to say, as he was alking to himself, “I think I have him!” Then he remained pensive for three ays, and uttered not a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held ad broken.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.26#Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute ense which certain words might present, there can be nothing really infallible n a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become onfused, thrown off the track, and defeated. Otherwise, it would be superior to ntelligence, and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light han man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.27#Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and ranquillity of M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.5.28#One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce an mpression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.head#CHAPTER VI—FATHER FAUCHELEVENT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.1#One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur M.; e heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached. An old man amed Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart, his horse having umbled down.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.2#This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at that ime. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an ex-notary and peasant who was almost educated, had a business which was beginning to be in a ad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich, while he, a awyer, was being ruined. This had filled him with jealousy, and he had done all e could, on every occasion, to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and s the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor hildren, he had turned carter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.3#The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caught in he wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle ested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. Father Fauchelevent was attling in the throat in the most lamentable manner. They had tried, but in ain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong hake, might kill him. It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by ifting the vehicle off of him. Javert, who had come up at the moment of the ccident, had sent for a jack-screw.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.4#M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.5#“Help!” cried old Fauchelevent. “Who will be good and save the old an?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.6#M. Madeleine turned towards those present:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.7#“Is there a jack-screw to be had?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.8#“One has been sent for,” answered the peasant.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.9#“How long will it take to get it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.10#“They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot’s place, where there is a arrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of an our.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.11#“A quarter of an hour!” exclaimed Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.12#It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.13#The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing the ld carter’s breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs would be broken n five minutes more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.14#“It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,” said Madeleine to he peasants, who were staring at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.15#“We must!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.16#“But it will be too late then! Don’t you see that the cart is inking?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.17#“Well!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.18#“Listen,” resumed Madeleine; “there is still room enough under the cart to llow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only half a minute, nd the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here who has stout loins and eart? There are five louis d’or to be earned!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.19#Not a man in the group stirred.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.21#The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: “A man would eed to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting crushed!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.22#“Come,” began Madeleine again, “twenty louis.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.23#The same silence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.24#“It is not the will which is lacking,” said a voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.25#M. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed him n his arrival.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.26#Javert went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.27#“It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as ift a cart like that on his back.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.28#Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every word hat he uttered:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.29#“Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doing what ou ask.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.30#Madeleine shuddered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.31#Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his eyes rom Madeleine:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.32#“He was a convict.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.33#“Ah!” said Madeleine.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.35#Madeleine turned pale.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.36#Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent rattled n the throat, and shrieked:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.37#“I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.38#Madeleine glanced about him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.39#“Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life f this poor old man?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.40#No one stirred. Javert resumed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.41#“I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, and e was that convict.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.42#“Ah! It is crushing me!” cried the old man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.43#Madeleine raised his head, met Javert’s falcon eye still fixed upon him, ooked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without saying a ord, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had time to utter a ry, he was underneath the vehicle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.44#A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.45#They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible eight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together. They houted to him, “Father Madeleine, come out!” Old Fauchelevent himself said to im, “Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You see that I am fated to die! Leave me! You ill get yourself crushed also!” Madeleine made no reply.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.46#All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and it ad become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under the ehicle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.47#Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the heels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying, “Make aste! Help!” It was Madeleine, who had just made a final effort.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.48#They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force and ourage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent was aved.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.6.49#Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. His lothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed his knees nd called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon his countenance an ndescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering, and he fixed his ranquil eye on Javert, who was still staring at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.7.head#CHAPTER VII—FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.7.1#Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine had im conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the actory building itself, and which was served by two sisters of charity. On the ollowing morning the old man found a thousand-franc bank-note on his ight-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine’s writing: _“I purchase your orse and cart.”_ The cart was broken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent ecovered, but his knee remained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of he sisters of charity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener n a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.7.2#Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first time that avert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over he town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on melling a wolf in his master’s clothes. From that time forth he avoided him as uch as he possibly could. When the requirements of the service imperatively emanded it, and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him ith profound respect.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.7.3#This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides the isible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was nonetheless ignificant for not being visible. This never deceives. When the population uffers, when work is lacking, when there is no commerce, the tax-payer resists mposts through penury, he exhausts and oversteps his respite, and the state xpends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection. When ork is abundant, when the country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily nd cost the state nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible hermometer of the public misery and riches,—the cost of collecting the taxes. n the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished hree-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this led to this rrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villèle, then inister of Finance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.7.4#Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No one emembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine’s factory was like the ace of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admitted to the women’s orkroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she could not be very skilful t it, and she therefore earned but little by her day’s work; but it was ufficient; the problem was solved; she was earning her living.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.head#CHAPTER VIII—MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON ORALITY
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.1#When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a oment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! The taste for ork had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in urveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many hings; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost appy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her uture work—a lingering trace of her improvident ways. As she was not able to ay that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her ittle girl.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.2#At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she nly knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public etter-writer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.3#She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, n the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways bout her.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.4#There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not oncerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why oes Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always ake the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach efore reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note aper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist eings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, oreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, ake more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that ratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for heir curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman or whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of he streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe rrand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, uy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for eeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often hese secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated y the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels, failures, the ruin of amilies, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out verything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad hing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.5#Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their onversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like hose chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of ombustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.6#So Fantine was watched.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.7#In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white eeth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.8#It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst f the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking f her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.9#Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.10#It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid he carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address: _Monsieur, onsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil_. The public writer, a good old an who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of ecrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that antine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was ound, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on er return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the hild.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.11#The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the uardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, nd re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a himsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her outh, in ’93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red ap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, eevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose idow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. he was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the estoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests ad forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she bequeathed with uch ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the piscopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and eturned with the remark, “I have seen the child.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.12#All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, hen, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs rom the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and equested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the neighborhood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.13#This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelve rancs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.14#Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in ebt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this ebt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to eave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good orkwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the hop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.8.15#She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the ayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was ood, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the ecision.

M. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men re often obliged to delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and he conviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent had instituted he suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.9.4#As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M. adeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for giving ssistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.9.5#Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood; she ent from house to house. No one would have her. She could not leave town. The econd-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for her furniture—and what urniture!—said to her, “If you leave, I will have you arrested as a thief.” The ouseholder, whom she owed for her rent, said to her, “You are young and pretty; ou can pay.” She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the urniture-dealer, returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only ecessaries, and found herself without work, without a trade, with nothing but er bed, and still about fifty francs in debt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.9.6#She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earned welve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was at this point that she egan to pay the Thénardiers irregularly.

No one knows all that certain feeble creatures, who have grown old in rivation and honesty, can get out of a sou. It ends by being a talent. Fantine cquired this sublime talent, and regained a little courage.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.9.9#At this epoch she said to a neighbor, “Bah!

Winter: no warmth, no light, no oonday, the evening joining on to the morning, fogs, twilight; the window is ray; it is impossible to see clearly at it. The sky is but a vent-hole. The hole day is a cavern. The sun has the air of a beggar. A frightful season! inter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone. Her reditors harrassed her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.2#Fantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thénardiers, who ere not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her o despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wrote to her that her ittle Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather, that she needed a oollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this. She eceived the letter, and crushed it in her hands all day long. That evening she ent into a barber’s shop at the corner of the street, and pulled out her comb. er admirable golden hair fell to her knees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.3#“What splendid hair!” exclaimed the barber.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.4#“How much will you give me for it?” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.5#“Ten francs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.6#“Cut it off.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.7#She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thénardiers. This etticoat made the Thénardiers furious. It was the money that they wanted. They ave the petticoat to Éponine. The poor Lark continued to shiver.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.8#Fantine thought: “My child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with my air.” She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and in which he was still pretty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.9#Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine’s heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.10#When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hate very one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration for Father adeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had ischarged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she came to hate him lso, and most of all. When she passed the factory in working hours, when the orkpeople were at the door, she affected to laugh and sing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.11#An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion aid, “There’s a girl who will come to a bad end.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.12#She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love, out f bravado and with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp, a sort of endicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and who abandoned her as she ad taken him, in disgust.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.13#She adored her child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.14#The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the more adiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said, “When I et rich, I will have my Cosette with me;” and she laughed. Her cough did not eave her, and she had sweats on her back.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.15#One day she received from the Thénardiers a letter couched in the ollowing terms: “Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the eighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs are required. This s ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them. If you do not send us forty rancs before the week is out, the little one will be dead.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.16#She burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: “Ah! they are good! orty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do they think I am to et them? These peasants are stupid, truly.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.17#Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the etter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running and leaping nd still laughing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.18#Some one met her and said to her, “What makes you so gay?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.19#She replied: “A fine piece of stupidity that some country people have ritten to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much for you, you easants!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.20#As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around a arriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red, ho was holding forth. He was a quack dentist on his rounds, who was offering to he public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders and elixirs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.21#Fantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at the arangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable eople. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl, and suddenly xclaimed: “You have beautiful teeth, you girl there, who are laughing; if you ant to sell me your palettes, I will give you a gold napoleon apiece for hem.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.22#“What are my palettes?” asked Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.23#“The palettes,” replied the dental professor, “are the front teeth, the wo upper ones.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.24#“How horrible!” exclaimed Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.25#“Two napoleons!” grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. “Here’s a ucky girl!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.26#Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice f the man shouting to her: “Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons; they may prove f service. If your heart bids you, come this evening to the inn of the _Tillac ’Argent_; you will find me there.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.27#Fantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence to her ood neighbor Marguerite: “Can you understand such a thing? Is he not an bominable man? How can they allow such people to go about the country! Pull out y two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! My hair will grow again, but my eeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! I should prefer to throw myself head first n the pavement from the fifth story! He told me that he should be at the Tillac d’Argent_ this evening.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.28#“And what did he offer?” asked Marguerite.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.29#“Two napoleons.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.30#“That makes forty francs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.31#“Yes,” said Fantine; “that makes forty francs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.32#She remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of a uarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thénardiers’ letter nce more on the staircase.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.33#On her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.34#“What is a miliary fever? Do you know?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.35#“Yes,” answered the old spinster; “it is a disease.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.36#“Does it require many drugs?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.37#“Oh! terrible drugs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.38#“How does one get it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.39#“It is a malady that one gets without knowing how.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.40#“Then it attacks children?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.41#“Children in particular.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.42#“Do people die of it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.43#“They may,” said Marguerite.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.44#Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the taircase.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.45#That evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the direction f the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.46#The next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine’s room before aylight,—for they always worked together, and in this manner used only one andle for the two,—she found Fantine seated on her bed, pale and frozen. She ad not lain down. Her cap had fallen on her knees. Her candle had burned all ight, and was almost entirely consumed. Marguerite halted on the threshold, etrified at this tremendous wastefulness, and exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.47#“Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.48#Then she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft of its air.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.49#Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.50#“Jesus!” said Marguerite, “what is the matter with you, Fantine?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.51#“Nothing,” replied Fantine. “Quite the contrary. My child will not die of hat frightful malady, for lack of succor. I am content.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.52#So saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were littering on the table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.53#“Ah! Jesus God!” cried Marguerite. “Why, it is a fortune! Where did you et those louis d’or?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.54#“I got them,” replied Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.55#At the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. It as a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, and she had black hole in her mouth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.56#The two teeth had been extracted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.57#She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.58#After all it was a ruse of the Thénardiers to obtain money. Cosette was ot ill.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.59#Fantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quitted her ell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it, next the oof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor, and nocks you on the head every instant. The poor occupant can reach the end of his hamber as he can the end of his destiny, only by bending over more and ore.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.60#She had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a mattress n the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebush which she ad, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the other corner was a utter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and in which the various levels f the water remained long marked by these circles of ice. She had lost her hame; she lost her coquetry. A final sign. She went out, with dirty caps. hether from lack of time or from indifference, she no longer mended her linen. s the heels wore out, she dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was vident from the perpendicular wrinkles. She patched her bodice, which was old nd worn out, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement. The eople to whom she was indebted made “scenes” and gave her no peace. She found hem in the street, she found them again on her staircase. She passed many a ight weeping and thinking. Her eyes were very bright, and she felt a steady ain in her shoulder towards the top of the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a reat deal. She deeply hated Father Madeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed eventeen hours a day; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the risoners work at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily arnings of working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and nine sous a ay! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer, who had aken back nearly all his furniture, said to her incessantly, “When will you pay e, you hussy?” What did they want of her, good God! She felt that she was being unted, and something of the wild beast developed in her. About the same time, hénardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability nd that he must have a hundred francs at once; otherwise he would turn little osette out of doors, convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the old and the streets, and that she might do what she liked with herself, and die f she chose. “A hundred francs,” thought Fantine. “But in what trade can one arn a hundred sous a day?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.61#“Come!” said she, “let us sell what is left.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.10.62#The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.1#What is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.2#From whom? From misery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.3#From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soul for a orsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.4#The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it does not, s yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared from European ivilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it weighs only upon the oman, and it is called prostitution.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.5#It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty, aternity. This is not one of the least of man’s disgraces.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.6#At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, nothing is eft to Fantine of that which she had formerly been.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.7#She has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold. She asses; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe and dishonored igure. Life and the social order have said their last word for her. All has appened to her that will happen to her. She has felt everything, borne verything, experienced everything, suffered everything, lost everything, ourned everything. She is resigned, with that resignation which resembles ndifference, as death resembles sleep. She no longer avoids anything. Let all he clouds fall upon her, and all the ocean sweep over her! What matters it to er? She is a sponge that is soaked.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.8#At least, she believes it to be so; but it is an error to imagine that fate an be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.11.9#Alas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither are they oing? Why are they thus?

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.1#There is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular, a lass of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs with the ame air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand francs a year n Paris. These are beings of the great neuter species: impotent men, parasites, yphers, who have a little land, a little folly, a little wit; who would be ustics in a drawing-room, and who think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; ho say, “My fields, my peasants, my woods”; who hiss actresses at the theatre o prove that they are persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the arrison to prove that they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of obacco, play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence, ive at the café, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the bones under the able, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table; who stick at a sou, xaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise women, wear out their old oots, copy London through Paris, and Paris through the medium of ont-à-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work, serve no use, and do no great arm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.2#M. Félix Tholomyès, had he remained in his own province and never beheld aris, would have been one of these men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.3#If they were richer, one would say, “They are dandies;” if they were oorer, one would say, “They are idlers.” They are simply men without mployment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers, and ome knaves.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.4#At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, a watch ith trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top of the other—the ed and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat, with a codfish tail, a ouble row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the houlder; and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive, ornamented on the wo seams with an indefinite, but always uneven, number of lines, varying from ne to eleven—a limit which was never exceeded. Add to this, high shoes with ittle irons on the heels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, n enormous cane, and conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all, spurs nd a moustache. At that epoch moustaches indicated the bourgeois, and spurs the edestrian.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.5#The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of oustaches.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.6#It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America with he King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats were oyalist, and were called _morillos_; liberals wore hats with wide brims, which ere called _bolivars_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.7#Eight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the preceding ages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one of these andies, one of these unemployed, a “right thinker,” for he wore a morillo, and as, moreover, warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the ashionable costume in cold weather, was amusing himself by tormenting a reature who was prowling about in a ball-dress, with neck uncovered and flowers n her hair, in front of the officers’ café. This dandy was smoking, for he was ecidedly fashionable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.8#Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her, ogether with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he considered witty nd mirthful, such as, “How ugly you are!—Will you get out of my sight?—You have o teeth!” etc., etc. This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois. The woman, a elancholy, decorated spectre which went and came through the snow, made him no eply, did not even glance at him, and nevertheless continued her promenade in ilence, and with a sombre regularity, which brought her every five minutes ithin reach of this sarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the ods. The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; and taking dvantage of a moment when her back was turned, he crept up behind her with the ait of a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down, picked up a handful of snow rom the pavement, and thrust it abruptly into her back, between her bare houlders. The woman uttered a roar, whirled round, gave a leap like a panther, nd hurled herself upon the man, burying her nails in his face, with the most rightful words which could fall from the guard-room into the gutter. These nsults, poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy, did, indeed, proceed in ideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth. It was Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.9#At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from the café, assers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, hooting and applauding, was ormed around this whirlwind composed of two beings, whom there was some ifficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: the man struggling, his hat on he ground; the woman striking out with feet and fists, bareheaded, howling, inus hair and teeth, livid with wrath, horrible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.10#Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd, seized he woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, and said to her, Follow me!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.12.11#The woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. Her eyes ere glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, and she trembled with a quiver of error. She had recognized Javert.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.1#Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out with long trides towards the police station, which is situated at the extremity of the quare, dragging the wretched woman after him. She yielded mechanically. Neither e nor she uttered a word. The cloud of spectators followed, jesting, in a aroxysm of delight. Supreme misery an occasion for obscenity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.2#On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by a stove, ith a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded by a etachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut the door ehind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who raised themselves on iptoe, and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the station-house, n their effort to see. Curiosity is a sort of gluttony. To see is to evour.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.3#On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute, crouching own like a terrified dog.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.4#The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javert eated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and began to rite.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.5#This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of he police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems good to them, nd confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their ndustry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; his grave face betrayed no motion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriously and deeply preoccupied. It was ne of those moments when he was exercising without control, but subject to all he scruples of a severe conscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At hat moment he was conscious that his police agent’s stool was a tribunal. He as entering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which ould possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing. The ore he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. It was vident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just eheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder and an lector, insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A rostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, avert. He wrote in silence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.6#When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to the ergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, “Take three men and conduct this reature to jail.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.7#Then, turning to Fantine, “You are to have six months of it.” The unhappy oman shuddered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.8#“Six months! six months of prison!” she exclaimed. “Six months in which to arn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter! my aughter! But I still owe the Thénardiers over a hundred francs; do you know hat, Monsieur Inspector?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.9#She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of all hose men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strides on her nees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.10#“Monsieur Javert,” said she, “I beseech your mercy. I assure you that I as not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have seen. I wear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That gentleman, the ourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has any one the right to put now down our backs when we are walking along peaceably, and doing no harm to ny one? I am rather ill, as you see. And then, he had been saying impertinent hings to me for a long time: ‘You are ugly! you have no teeth!’ I know well hat I have no longer those teeth. I did nothing; I said to myself, ‘The entleman is amusing himself.’ I was honest with him; I did not speak to him. It as at that moment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good onsieur Inspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you hat this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that one is ot master of one’s self at the first moment. One gives way to vivacity; and hen, when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not xpecting it! I did wrong to spoil that gentleman’s hat. Why did he go away? I ould ask his pardon. Oh, my God! It makes no difference to me whether I ask his ardon. Do me the favor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not now that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the overnment’s fault, but seven sous is one’s earnings; and just fancy, I must pay ne hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh, my God! I cannot ave her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my Cosette! Oh, my little angel of he Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature? I will tell you: it is he Thénardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and such people are unreasonable. They ant money. Don’t put me in prison! You see, there is a little girl who will be urned out into the street to get along as best she may, in the very heart of he winter; and you must have pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert. If he were older, she might earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age. I m not a bad woman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made e what I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do not love it; ut it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only necessary to glance nto my closets, and it would have been evident that I was not a coquettish and ntidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pity on me, Monsieur avert!”

Great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray, which ransfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine had become beautiful once more. rom time to time she paused, and tenderly kissed the police agent’s coat. She ould have softened a heart of granite; but a heart of wood cannot be oftened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.12#“Come!” said Javert, “I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished? ou will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could do othing more.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.13#At these solemn words, _“the Eternal Father in person could do nothing ore,”_ she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down, murmuring, Mercy!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.14#Javert turned his back.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.15#The soldiers seized her by the arms.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.16#A few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heed to im. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened to Fantine’s espairing supplications.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.17#At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate oman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.18#“One moment, if you please.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.19#Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat, nd, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.20#“Excuse me, Mr. Mayor—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.21#The words “Mr. Mayor” produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She rose to er feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth, thrust aside he soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M. Madeleine before any one ould prevent her, and gazing intently at him, with a bewildered air, she ried:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.22#“Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.23#Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.24#M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.25#“Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.26#Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at that oment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent emotions hich he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of the town spit in he mayor’s face was a thing so monstrous that, in his most daring flights of ancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. On the ther hand, at the very bottom of his thought, he made a hideous comparison as o what this woman was, and as to what this mayor might be; and then he, with orror, caught a glimpse of I know not what simple explanation of this rodigious attack. But when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe is face and say, _“Set this woman at liberty,”_ he underwent a sort of ntoxication of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of ossible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.27#The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raised er bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who is eeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in a low voice, s though talking to herself:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.28#“At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for six onths! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have said that. I id not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a mayor! Was it you, my ood Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be set free? Oh, see here! I will ell you about it, and you will let me go. That monster of a mayor, that old lackguard of a mayor, is the cause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he urned me out! all because of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the orkroom. If that is not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing er work honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery ollowed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these gentlemen of he police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison contractors from ronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you see: you are earning twelve ous at shirt-making, the price falls to nine sous; and it is not enough to live n. Then one has to become whatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, nd I was actually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is hat that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped on hat gentleman’s hat in front of the officers’ café; but he had spoiled my whole ress with snow. We women have but one silk dress for evening wear. You see that did not do wrong deliberately—truly, Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold omen who are far more wicked than I, and who are much happier. O Monsieur avert! it was you who gave orders that I am to be set free, was it not? Make nquiries, speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you hat I am perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have nintentionally touched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.29#M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she was peaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened it. It was mpty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, “How much did you say hat you owed?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.30#Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.31#“Was I speaking to you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.32#Then, addressing the soldiers:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.33#“Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old wretch f a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I’m not afraid of you. I am afraid f Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.34#So saying, she turned to the inspector again:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.35#“And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I understand hat you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly simple: a man amuses imself by putting snow down a woman’s back, and that makes the officers laugh; ne must divert themselves in some way; and we—well, we are here for them to muse themselves with, of course! And then, you, you come; you are certainly bliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on eflection, since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it s for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my upporting my child. ‘Only, don’t do it again, you hussy!’ Oh! I won’t do it gain, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not tir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not expecting that now from the gentleman at all; and then as I told you, I am not well; I have a ough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor tells me, Take care of yourself.’ Here, feel, give me your hand; don’t be afraid—it is ere.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.36#She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert’s coarse and on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.37#All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the olds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along, lmost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door, saying to the oldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.38#“Children, Monsieur l’Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, and I m going.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.39#She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would be n the street.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.40#Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyes ixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue, which s waiting to be put away somewhere.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.41#The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expression f sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the uthority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild beast, atrocious in the an of no estate.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.42#“Sergeant!” he cried, “don’t you see that that jade is walking off! Who ade you let her go?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.43#“I,” said Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.44#Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert’s voice, and let go of the latch s a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound of adeleine’s voice she turned around, and from that moment forth she uttered no ord, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glance strayed from adeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn, according to which as speaking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.45#It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure efore he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done, fter the mayor’s suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty. Had he eached the point of forgetting the mayor’s presence? Had he finally declared to imself that it was impossible that any “authority” should have given such an rder, and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for nother, without intending it? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had een a witness for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was ecessary to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the mall should be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a agistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and that, n this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, society in its ntirety, was personified in him, Javert?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.46#However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as we have ust heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor, pale, old, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole body agitated by an mperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, and say to him, with owncast eyes but a firm voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.47#“Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.48#“Why not?” said M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.49#“This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.50#“Inspector Javert,” replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone, listen. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explaining matters o you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing through the square ust as you were leading this woman away; there were still groups of people tanding about, and I made inquiries and learned everything; it was the townsman ho was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted olice.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.51#Javert retorted:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.52#“This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.53#“That concerns me,” said M. Madeleine. “My own insult belongs to me, I hink. I can do what I please about it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.54#“I beg Monsieur le Maire’s pardon. The insult is not to him but to the aw.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.55#“Inspector Javert,” replied M. Madeleine, “the highest law is conscience. have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.56#“And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.57#“Then content yourself with obeying.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.58#“I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve six onths in prison.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.59#M. Madeleine replied gently:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.60#“Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.61#At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the ayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly espectful:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.62#“I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my ife, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my uthority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the question f the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself on Monsieur amatabois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a alcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade, three stories high and ntirely of cut stone. Such things as there are in the world! In any case, onsieur le Maire, this is a question of police regulations in the streets, and oncerns me, and I shall detain this woman Fantine.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.63#Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no one n the town had heard hitherto:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.64#“The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police. ccording to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and sixty-six of the ode of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order that this woman shall be et at liberty.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.65#Javert ventured to make a final effort.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.66#“But, Mr. Mayor—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.67#“I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December, 799, in regard to arbitrary detention.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.68#“Monsieur le Maire, permit me—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.69#“Not another word.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.70#“But—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.71#“Leave the room,” said M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.72#Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like a ussian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the oom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.73#Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he assed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.74#Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had just een herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She had seen two en who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul, her child, in ombat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness, he other was leading her back towards the light. In this conflict, viewed hrough the exaggerations of terror, these two men had appeared to her like two iants; the one spoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel ad conquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder from ead to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom he abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her oes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted him in so ideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been mistaken? Must she hange her whole soul? She did not know; she trembled. She listened in ewilderment, she looked on in affright, and at every word uttered by M. adeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, nd something warm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy, confidence nd love, dawn in her heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.75#When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and said o her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish to weep and ho finds some difficulty in speaking:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.76#“I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believe hat it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant of the fact hat you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But here; I will pay our debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go to her. You shall live ere, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake the care of your child and ourself. You shall not work any longer if you do not like. I will give all the oney you require. You shall be honest and happy once more. And listen! I eclare to you that if all is as you say,—and I do not doubt it,—you have never eased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.77#This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this life f infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to see all these ealities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery. She stared tupidly at this man who was talking to her, and could only give vent to two or hree sobs, “Oh! Oh! Oh!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.5.13.78#Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, and efore he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to t.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.1#M. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established n his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put her to bed. A burning ever had come on. She passed a part of the night in delirium and raving. At ength, however, she fell asleep.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.2#On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one breathing lose to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standing there nd looking at something over her head. His gaze was full of pity, anguish, and upplication. She followed its direction, and saw that it was fixed on a rucifix which was nailed to the wall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.3#Thenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine’s eyes. He seemed to er to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She gazed at im for a long time without daring to interrupt him. At last she said imidly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.4#“What are you doing?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.5#M. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantine to wake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.6#“How do you feel?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.7#“Well, I have slept,” she replied; “I think that I am better. It is othing.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.8#He answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him as hough he had just heard it:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.9#“I was praying to the martyr there on high.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.10#And he added in his own mind, “For the martyr here below.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.11#M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries. He new all now. He knew Fantine’s history in all its heart-rending details. He ent on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.12#“You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have he dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels. It is ot their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise. You see this hell rom which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven. It was necessary o begin there.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.13#He sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which wo teeth were lacking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.14#That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it imself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the uperscription ran: _To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le Préfet of olice_. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited about, the ost-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off, nd who recognized Javert’s handwriting on the cover, thought that he was ending in his resignation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.15#M. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thénardiers. Fantine owed them one undred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs, telling them to ay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the child instantly to M. sur M., here her sick mother required her presence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.16#This dazzled Thénardier. “The devil!” said the man to his wife; “don’t et’s allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch cow. I see hrough it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.17#He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd rancs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred rancs,—one for the doctor, the other for the apothecary who had attended and hysicked Éponine and Azelma through two long illnesses. Cosette, as we have lready said, had not been ill. It was only a question of a trifling ubstitution of names. At the foot of the memorandum Thénardier wrote, _Received n account, three hundred francs_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.18#M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote, “Make aste to bring Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.19#“Christi!” said Thénardier, “let’s not give up the child.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.20#In the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in the nfirmary.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.21#The sisters had at first only received and nursed “that woman” with epugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall the nflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish irgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajæ is one of the most rofound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters felt it with the double orce contributed by religion. But in a few days Fantine disarmed them. She said ll kinds of humble and gentle things, and the mother in her provoked enderness. One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever: “I have been a inner; but when I have my child beside me, it will be a sign that God has ardoned me. While I was leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my osette with me; I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her ake that I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the enediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her; it will o me good to see that innocent creature. She knows nothing at all. She is an ngel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have not fallen off.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.23#“Shall I see my Cosette soon?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.24#He answered:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.1.28#We have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary, er condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. That handful of now applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had brought about a udden suppression of perspiration, as a consequence of which the malady which ad been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last. t that time people were beginning to follow the fine Laënnec’s fine suggestions n the study and treatment of chest maladies. The doctor sounded Fantine’s chest nd shook his head.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.1#One morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging in advance ome pressing matters connected with the mayor’s office, in case he should ecide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informed that Police nspector Javert was desirous of speaking with him. Madeleine could not refrain rom a disagreeable impression on hearing this name. Javert had avoided him more han ever since the affair of the police-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen im.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.2#“Admit him,” he said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.3#Javert entered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.4#M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyes ixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and which ontained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police egulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert’s account. He could not help hinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be glacial in his manner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.5#Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned to im. The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating this docket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.6#Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, without reaking the silence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.7#If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who had made a engthy study of this savage in the service of civilization, this singular omposite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the corporal, this spy who as incapable of a lie, this unspotted police agent—if any physiognomist had nown his secret and long-cherished aversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with he mayor on the subject of Fantine, and had examined Javert at that moment, he ould have said to himself, “What has taken place?” It was evident to any one cquainted with that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and ferocious onscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle. avert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance. Like iolent people in general, he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion. His hysiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling. On entering he bowed to . Madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; e halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor’s armchair, and there he stood, erfectly erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous oughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient; he aited without uttering a word, without making a movement, in genuine humility nd tranquil resignation, calm, serious, hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and n expression which was half-way between that of a soldier in the presence of is officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge, until it should please he mayor to turn round. All the sentiments as well as all the memories which ne might have attributed to him had disappeared. That face, as impenetrable and imple as granite, no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy epression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an ndescribable courageous despondency.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.8#At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.9#“Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.10#Javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas, then aised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not, however, preclude implicity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.11#“This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.12#“What act?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.13#“An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in the ravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact to your nowledge, as it is my duty to do.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.14#“Who is the agent?” asked M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.15#“I,” said Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.16#“You?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.17#“I.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.18#“And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.19#“You, Mr. Mayor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.20#M. Madeleine sat erect in his armchair. Javert went on, with a severe air nd his eyes still cast down.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.21#“Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities to ismiss me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.22#M. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.23#“You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that does ot suffice. Handing in one’s resignation is honorable. I have failed in my uty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.24#And after a pause he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.25#“Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be so o-day, with justice.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.26#“Come, now! Why?” exclaimed M. Madeleine. “What nonsense is this? What is he meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me? What ave you done to me? What are your wrongs with regard to me? You accuse ourself; you wish to be superseded—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.27#“Turned out,” said Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.28#“Turned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.29#“You shall understand, Mr. Mayor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.30#Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, still coldly nd sadly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.31#“Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman, I as furious, and I informed against you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.32#“Informed against me!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.33#“At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.34#M. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than avert himself, burst out laughing now:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.35#“As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.36#“As an ex-convict.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.37#The mayor turned livid.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.38#Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.39#“I thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance; nquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength of your oins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in marksmanship; your eg, which you drag a little;—I hardly know what all,—absurdities! But, at all vents, I took you for a certain Jean Valjean.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.40#“A certain—What did you say the name was?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.41#“Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty ears ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On leaving the alleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; then he committed nother theft, accompanied with violence, on a public highway on the person of a ittle Savoyard. He disappeared eight years ago, no one knows how, and he has een sought, I fancied. In short, I did this thing! Wrath impelled me; I enounced you at the Prefecture!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.42#M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments before his, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.43#“And what reply did you receive?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.44#“That I was mad.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.45#“Well?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.46#“Well, they were right.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.47#“It is lucky that you recognize the fact.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.48#“I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.49#The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his hand; e raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with his indescribable ccent:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.50#“Ah!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.51#Javert continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.52#“This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the eighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called Father hampmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any attention to him. o one knows what such people subsist on. Lately, last autumn, Father hampmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from—Well, no atter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. My hampmathieu was arrested. He still had the branch of apple-tree in his hand. he scamp is locked up. Up to this point it was merely an affair of a isdemeanor. But here is where Providence intervened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.53#“The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it onvenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental prison is ituated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet, who is etained for I know not what, and who has been appointed turnkey of the house, ecause of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than revet exclaims: ‘Eh! Why, I know that man! He is a _fagot!_4 Take a good look t me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!’ ‘Jean Valjean! who’s Jean Valjean?’ hampmathieu feigns astonishment. ‘Don’t play the innocent dodge,’ says Brevet. You are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty ears ago; we were there together.’ Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You nderstand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for me. This s what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner f trees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace of him as lost. A long time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, here he is said to have been a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was laundress; but that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for heft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another act. This Valjean’s Christian name was Jean, and his mother’s surname was athieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the galleys, e should have taken his mother’s name for the purpose of concealing himself, nd have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local ronunciation turns _Jean_ into _Chan_—he is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers o opposition, and behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do ou not? Inquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no onger there. It is not known where they have gone. You know that among those lasses a family often disappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. When uch people are not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the story ates thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew Jean aljean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two onvicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and henildieu, and are sentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and onfronted with the pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean aljean for them as well as for Brevet. The same age,—he is fifty-four,—the same eight, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this oment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I was told hat I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of he authorities. You can imagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for e; Champmathieu is conducted to me—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.54#“Well?” interposed M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.55#Javert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.56#“Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is Jean aljean. I recognized him also.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.57#M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.58#“You are sure?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.59#Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from profound onviction.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.60#“O! Sure!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.61#He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches of owdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table, nd he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.62#“And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how I ould have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.63#Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man, who ix weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station-house, nd bade him “leave the room,”—Javert, that haughty man, was unconsciously full f simplicity and dignity,—M. Madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than he abrupt question:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.64#“And what does this man say?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.65#“Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it’s a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, he has is previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a branch, to urloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for a man it is a isdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbing and housebreaking—it is all here. It is no longer a question of correctional police; it is a matter for the ourt of Assizes. It is no longer a matter of a few days in prison; it is the alleys for life. And then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who ill return, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is here not? Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly dog. hat is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt that things were etting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry out—the kettle sings before he fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, _et cetera_. But he has not the ppearance of understanding; he says, ‘I am Champmathieu, and I won’t depart rom that!’ He has an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; it is far etter. Oh! the rogue is clever! But it makes no difference. The proofs are here. He has been recognized by four persons; the old scamp will be condemned. he case has been taken to the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my estimony. I have been summoned.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.66#M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, and as turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns, like a usy man. He turned to Javert:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.67#“That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but little. e are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand. Javert, you will etake yourself at once to the house of the woman Buseaupied, who sells herbs at he corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You will tell her that she must enter her omplaint against carter Pierre Chesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near rushing this woman and her child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. harcellay, Rue Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on the djoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises, and is undermining he foundations of his house. After that, you will verify the infractions of olice regulations which have been reported to me in the Rue Guibourg, at Widow oris’s, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame Renée le Bossé‘s, and you will repare documents. But I am giving you a great deal of work. Are you not to be bsent? Did you not tell me that you were going to Arras on that matter in a eek or ten days?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.87#But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.6.2.88#“So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is the ay I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is our right to herish suspicion, although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse. But ithout proofs, in a fit of rage, with the object of wreaking my vengeance, I ave denounced you as a convict, you, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! hat is serious, very serious. I have insulted authority in your person, I, an gent of the authorities! If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I hould have declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled him. Well? top, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in the course of my ife towards others. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were not severe owards myself, all the justice that I have done would become injustice. Ought I o spare myself more than others? No! What! I should be good for nothing but to hastise others, and not myself! Why, I should be a blackguard! Those who say, That blackguard of a Javert!’ would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire hat you should treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me hen it was directed to others. I want none of it for myself. The kindness which onsists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the police agent gainst the mayor, the man who is down against the man who is up in the world, s what I call false kindness. That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes ociety. Good God! it is very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being ust. Come! if you had been what I thought you, I should not have been kind to ou, not I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would treat ny other man. When I have subdued malefactors, when I have proceeded with vigor gainst rascals, I have often said to myself, ‘If you flinch, if I ever catch ou in fault, you may rest at your ease!’ I have flinched, I have caught myself n a fault. So much the worse! Come, discharged, cashiered, expelled! That is ell. I have arms. I will till the soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr. ayor, the good of the service demands an example.

The transition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least iolent; the one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorance ommon to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand, and laces the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a little more amplitude n the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perpétue was a robust nun from arines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, sugared the otion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid, treated her atients abruptly, roughly, was crabbed with the dying, almost flung God in heir faces, stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, onest, and ruddy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.1.6#Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpétue, she as the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the eatures of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in which he mingles s much freedom as servitude: “They shall have for their convent only the house f the sick; for cell only a hired room; for chapel only their parish church; or cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals; for nclosure only obedience; for gratings only the fear of God; for veil only odesty.” This ideal was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she ad never been young, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one ould have told Sister Simplice’s age. She was a person—we dare not say a oman—who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied. She was o gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid than granite. She ouched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine. There was, o to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, and she ossessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or nchanted a drawing-room. This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, inding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of God. Let us mphasize one detail. Never to have lied, never to have said, for any interest hatever, even in indifference, any single thing which was not the truth, the acred truth, was Sister Simplice’s distinctive trait; it was the accent of her irtue. She was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable eracity. The Abbé Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute assieu. However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor the rack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, innocent lie—does uch a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. To lie a little is not ossible: he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demon. atan has two names; he is called Satan and Lying. That is what she thought; and s she thought, so she did. The result was the whiteness which we have entioned—a whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. er smile was white, her glance was white. There was not a single spider’s web, ot a grain of dust, on the glass window of that conscience. On entering the rder of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special hoice. Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred to allow both er breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta hen she had been born at Syracuse—a lie which would have saved her. This patron aint suited this soul.

He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then e paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after the lapse of few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly, he placed it ently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent reviously.

He ascended to his room, and here he shut himself up, which was a very simple act, since he liked to go to ed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the factory, who was, at the same time, . Madeleine’s only servant, noticed that the latter’s light was extinguished at alf-past eight, and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, dding:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.2.71#“Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air.”

He listened; it was a footstep pacing back and forth, as though ome one were walking in the room above him. He listened more attentively, and ecognized M. Madeleine’s step. This struck him as strange; usually, there was o noise in M. Madeleine’s chamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later he cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and hen shut again; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued; hen the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, and taring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted indow reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the rays, it could nly come from the window of M. Madeleine’s chamber. The reflection wavered, as hough it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle. The hadow of the window-frame was not shown, which indicated that the window was ide open. The fact that this window was open in such cold weather was urprising. The cashier fell asleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. he same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth verhead.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.2#We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment has ow come when we must take another look into it. We do so not without emotion nd trepidation. There is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of ontemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance nd more shadow than in man; it can fix itself on no other thing which is more ormidable, more complicated, more mysterious, and more infinite. There is a pectacle more grand than the sea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand han heaven; it is the inmost recesses of the soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.3#To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference to a ingle man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would be to blend ll epics into one superior and definitive epic. Conscience is the chaos of himæras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace of dreams; the lair of ideas f which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium of sophisms; it is the attlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of human being who is engaged in reflection, and look behind, gaze into that oul, gaze into that obscurity. There, beneath that external silence, battles of iants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons and ydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, as in Dante. hat a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him, and which e measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of is life!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.4#Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which he esitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Let us nter, nevertheless.

From that oment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man. What the Bishop ad wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was more than a ransformation; it was a transfiguration.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.6#He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop’s silver, reserving only the andlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed France, came to . sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned, accomplished what we have elated, succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible, and, henceforth, established at M. sur M., happy in feeling his conscience saddened y the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last, he lived in eace, reassured and hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,—to conceal is name and to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.7#These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed ut a single one there; both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his lightest actions. In general, they conspired to regulate the conduct of his ife; they turned him towards the gloom; they rendered him kindly and simple; hey counselled him to the same things. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In hat case, as the reader will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur . called M. Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second—his ecurity to his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence, e had preserved the Bishop’s candlesticks, worn mourning for him, summoned and nterrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that way, collected information egarding the families at Faverolles, and saved old Fauchelevent’s life, despite he disquieting insinuations of Javert. It seemed, as we have already remarked, s though he thought, following the example of all those who have been wise, oly, and just, that his first duty was not towards himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.8#At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet resented itself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.9#Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we re narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this confusedly ut profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert, when the latter ntered his study. At the moment when that name, which he had buried beneath so any layers, was so strangely articulated, he was struck with stupor, and as hough intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny; and through his stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an ak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He elt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head. As he istened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was to go, to run nd denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prison and place himself here; this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh. hen it passed away, and he said to himself, “We will see! We will see!” He epressed this first, generous instinct, and recoiled before heroism.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.10#It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop’s holy words, after so any years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence admirably egun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even in the presence of so errible a conjecture, but had continued to walk with the same step towards this awning precipice, at the bottom of which lay heaven; that would have been eautiful; but it was not thus. We must render an account of the things which ent on in this soul, and we can only tell what there was there. He was carried way, at first, by the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas n haste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert’s presence, that reat danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror, shook off hought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up is buckler.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.11#He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind within, profound tranquillity without. He took no “preservative measures,” as they may e called.

Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done? Had e not another and a grand object, which was the true one—to save, not his erson, but his soul; to become honest and good once more; to be a just man? Was t not that above all, that alone, which he had always desired, which the Bishop ad enjoined upon him—to shut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! reat God! he was re-opening it by committing an infamous action! He was ecoming a thief once more, and the most odious of thieves! He was robbing nother of his existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. He was ecoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretched man. He as inflicting on him that frightful living death, that death beneath the open ky, which is called the galleys. On the other hand, to surrender himself to ave that man, struck down with so melancholy an error, to resume his own name, o become once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, in truth, o achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that hell whence he had just merged; to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality. This ust be done! He had done nothing if he did not do all this; his whole life was seless; all his penitence was wasted. There was no longer any need of saying, What is the use?” He felt that the Bishop was there, that the Bishop was resent all the more because he was dead, that the Bishop was gazing fixedly at im, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his virtues, would be abominable o him, and that the convict Jean Valjean would be pure and admirable in his ight; that men beheld his mask, but that the Bishop saw his face; that men saw is life, but that the Bishop beheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, eliver the false Jean Valjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that was the reatest of sacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step to take; ut it must be done.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.90#“Hold!” he thought; “the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. They must e destroyed also.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.91#He seized the two candlesticks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.92#There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape, and onverted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.93#He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a sense f real comfort. “How good warmth is!” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.94#He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.95#A minute more, and they were both in the fire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.96#At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting: Jean Valjean! Jean Valjean!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.97#His hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to some errible thing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.98#“Yes, that’s it! finish!” said the voice. “Complete what you are about! estroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop! Forget verything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is right! Applaud yourself! So t is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed: here is an old man who does not know hat is wanted of him, who has, perhaps, done nothing, an innocent man, whose hole misfortune lies in your name, upon whom your name weighs like a crime, who s about to be taken for you, who will be condemned, who will finish his days in bjectness and horror. That is good! Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur e Maire; remain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent; ear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during this time, while ou are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a man who will wear our red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your hain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arranged thus. Ah, wretch!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.99#The perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on the andlesticks. But that within him which had spoken had not finished. The voice ontinued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.100#“Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make a reat noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, and only one hich no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark. Well! listen, nfamous man! All those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven, nd only the malediction will ascend to God.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.101#This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the most bscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling and formidable, nd he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed to him that it had detached tself from him, and that it was now speaking outside of him. He thought that he eard the last words so distinctly, that he glanced around the room in a sort of error.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.102#“Is there any one here?” he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.103#Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.105#There was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom the uman eye cannot see.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.107#Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled the reams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.108#This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him. It ometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved about for the urpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change of lace. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.109#He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he ad arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally atal. What a fatality!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.110#There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself, reat God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all that he should e obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged to take up once more. He hould have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good, so pure, so adiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to liberty. He should never more troll in the fields; he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of ay; he should never more bestow alms on the little children; he should never ore experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon im; he should quit that house which he had built, that little chamber! verything seemed charming to him at that moment. Never again should he read hose books; never more should he write on that little table of white wood; his ld portress, the only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his offee in the morning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron ecklet, the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp ed all those horrors which he knew so well! At his age, after having been what e was! If he were only young again! but to be addressed in his old age as thou” by any one who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard; to receive he galley-sergeant’s cudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare feet; to ave to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who isits the gang; to submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would be told: That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was mayor of M. sur M.”; and at ight, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed with lassitude, their green caps rawn over their eyes, to remount, two by two, the ladder staircase of the alleys beneath the sergeant’s whip. Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as alicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human eart?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.111#And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma hich lay at the foundation of his reverie: “Should he remain in paradise and ecome a demon? Should he return to hell and become an angel?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.113#The torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was nchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused once more; they ssumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair. he name of Romainville recurred incessantly to his mind, with the two verses of song which he had heard in the past. He thought that Romainville was a little rove near Paris, where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of pril.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.114#He wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little child ho is permitted to toddle alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.3.115#At intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort to recover he mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the last time, and efinitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallen prostrate with atigue: Ought he to denounce himself? Ought he to hold his peace? He could not anage to see anything distinctly. The vague aspects of all the courses of easoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished, ne after the other, into smoke. He only felt that, to whatever course of action e made up his mind, something in him must die, and that of necessity, and ithout his being able to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on he right hand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death gony,—the agony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.

Eighteen hundred ears before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom are summed up ll the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside ith his hand, while the olive-trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite, he terrible cup which appeared to Him dripping with darkness and overflowing ith shadows in the depths all studded with stars.

This nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on. It is ne of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.4.25#From his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. A harp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from the earth.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.1#The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this eriod by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagons were wo-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with fawn-colored leather, hung on prings, and having but two seats, one for the postboy, the other for the raveller. The wheels were armed with those long, offensive axles which keep ther vehicles at a distance, and which may still be seen on the road in ermany. The despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the ehicle and formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black, and the abriolet yellow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.2#These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something istorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in the istance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled the insects hich are called, I think, termites, and which, though with but little corselet, rag a great train behind them. But they travelled at a very rapid rate. The ost-wagon which set out from Arras at one o’clock every night, after the mail rom Paris had passed, arrived at M. sur M. a little before five o’clock in the orning.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.3#That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin road, ollided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the town, with a ittle tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going in the opposite irection, and in which there was but one person, a man enveloped in a mantle. he wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock. The postman shouted to he man to stop, but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full allop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.4#“That man is in a devilish hurry!” said the postman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.5#The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in onvulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.6#Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening? He did ot know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? To Arras, no doubt; ut he might have been going elsewhere as well. At times he was conscious of it, nd he shuddered. He plunged into the night as into a gulf. Something urged him orward; something drew him on. No one could have told what was taking place ithin him; every one will understand it. What man is there who has not entered, t least once in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.7#However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan, done othing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive. He was, more han ever, as he had been at the first moment.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.9#He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired caufflaire’s cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was no eason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters for imself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took place; that no ecision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized; that one ade mountains out of everything from a distance; that, at any rate, when he hould have seen that Champmathieu, some wretch, his conscience would probably e greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert ould indeed be there; and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old onvicts who had known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;—bah! hat an idea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that ll conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and that there s nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures; that accordingly there as no danger.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.10#That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from it; hat, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in his own hand; hat he was master of it. He clung to this thought.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.13#As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at that ine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an our.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.15#At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far ehind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the chilly igures of a winter’s dawn as they passed before his eyes, but without seeing hem. The morning has its spectres as well as the evening. He did not see them; ut without his being aware of it, and by means of a sort of penetration which as almost physical, these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some loomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.16#Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes order on the highway, he said to himself, “And yet there are people there ithin who are sleeping!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.17#The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road, roduced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming when one is oyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.18#It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of the nn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given some oats.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.19#The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the oulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough neck and houlders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin, fine legs, and olid hoofs—a homely, but a robust and healthy race. The excellent beast had ravelled five leagues in two hours, and had not a drop of sweat on his oins.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.20#He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats uddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.28#The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyes fixed n the wheel; then he rose erect and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.108#It was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who had roken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road. He had not ielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made every possible effort to ontinue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means; he ad been deterred neither by the season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had othing with which to reproach himself. If he went no further, that was no fault f his. It did not concern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not he act of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.109#He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs or the first time since Javert’s visit. It seemed to him that the hand of iron hich had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just eleased him.

Any colloquy in the street nevitably attracts a crowd. There are always people who ask nothing better than o become spectators. While he was questioning the wheelwright, some people who ere passing back and forth halted around them.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.115#These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the erspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand which ad relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready to seize him nce more.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.117#“Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.118#And he hastened to add:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.124#The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. The heelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the traveller scaping their clutches, interfered.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.128#At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a oment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he as now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of wrath, and found it bsurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back? After all, he was taking this rip of his own free will. No one was forcing him to it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.5.138#He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good. he little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the month of ebruary, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then, it was no longer he tilbury.

As in the orning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields pass by, nd the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the road, vanished; his is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul, and almost elieves it from thought. What is more melancholy and more profound than to see thousand objects for the first and the last time? To travel is to be born and o die at every instant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make omparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all the things f life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and bright intervals are ntermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse; we look, we hasten, we tretch out our hands to grasp what is passing; each event is a turn in the oad, and, all at once, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we istinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us alts, and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.1#But at that moment Fantine was joyous.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.2#She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever had oubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the doctor paid is visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look, and ordered that he hould be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.3#All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits in her heets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations which seemed to be alculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow and staring. They seemed almost xtinguished at intervals, then lighted up again and shone like stars. It seems s though, at the approach of a certain dark hour, the light of heaven fills hose who are quitting the light of earth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.4#Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she replied nvariably, “Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.5#Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her last odesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of herself; now he was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had completed the work of oral suffering. This creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow, flabby heeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from which the gums had receded, a leaden omplexion, a bony neck, prominent shoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, nd her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray. Alas! how illness mprovises old-age!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.6#At midday the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired whether he mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook his head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.7#M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o’clock. As exactness s kindness, he was exact.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.8#About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of twenty inutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, “What time is it, sister?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.9#Three o’clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she who ould, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshless hands in a ort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one of those profound ighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantine turned and looked at the oor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.10#No one entered; the door did not open.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.11#She remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the door, otionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared not speak to her. he clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell back on her pillow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.12#She said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.13#Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clock truck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell back gain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.14#Her thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she made no omplaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way. One would ave said that something dark was descending upon her. She was livid and her ips were blue. She smiled now and then.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.15#Five o’clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently, He is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.17#In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She seemed o be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began to sing in a voice s feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is what Fantine was singing:—

Make of it, soiling not, poiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I will embroider and ill with flowers.’—‘Madame, the child is no longer here; what is to be one?’—‘Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to bury me.’
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.24#“Lovely things we will buy As we stroll the faubourgs through, Roses are ink, corn-flowers are blue, I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.25#This song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days, ulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to her mind in ll the five years during which she had been parted from her child. She sang it n so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that it was enough to make any one, ven a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed as she was to austerities, felt a tear pring to her eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.26#The clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longer eemed to pay attention to anything about her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.27#Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the actory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to the nfirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.28#Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.29#The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor ad set out that morning before six o’clock, in a little tilbury harnessed to a hite horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone alone, without even a river; that no one knew what road he had taken; that people said he had been een to turn into the road to Arras; that others asserted that they had met him n the road to Paris. That when he went away he had been very gentle, as usual, nd that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.30#While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned to antine’s bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing, Fantine, with he feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, which unite the free ovements of health with the frightful emaciation of death, had raised herself o her knees in bed, with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster, and her ead thrust through the opening of the curtains, and was listening. All at once he cried:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.31#“You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What is he oing? Why does he not come?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.32#Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard he voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.33#“Answer me!” cried Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.34#The servant stammered:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.36#“Be calm, my child,” said the sister; “lie down again.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.37#Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, and ith an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.38#“He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it to ach other there. I want to know it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.39#The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun’s ear, “Say that he is busy ith the city council.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.40#Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid had roposed to her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.41#On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the ruth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, and that his was a serious matter in Fantine’s present state. Her flush did not last ong; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, and said, “Monsieur le aire has gone away.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.42#Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyes parkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.43#“Gone!” she cried; “he has gone to get Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.44#Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable; er lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.45#When her prayer was finished, “Sister,” she said, “I am willing to lie own again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I beg your ardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly; I know that ell, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the good God is good; M. adeleine is good; just think! he has gone to Montfermeil to get my little osette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.46#She lay down again, with the nun’s assistance, helped the nun to arrange er pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck, and hich Sister Simplice had given her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.47#“My child,” said the sister, “try to rest now, and do not talk any ore.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.48#Fantine took the sister’s hand in her moist hands, and the latter was ained to feel that perspiration.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.49#“He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go through aris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do you remember ow he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette, _Soon, soon?_ He ants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign a letter so that she ould be taken from the Thénardiers; they cannot say anything, can they? they ill give back Cosette, for they have been paid; the authorities will not allow hem to keep the child since they have received their pay. Do not make signs to e that I must not talk, sister! I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ll at all any more; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it s nearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much attached ne gets to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will see! If you only new what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the first place, she will have ery beautiful hands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old; ike this! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite a oung lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is really Euphrasie. Stop! this orning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea ome across me, like that, that I should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how rong it is not to see one’s children for years! One ought to reflect that life s not eternal. Oh, how good M. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; e had on his cloak, at least? he will be here to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow ill be a festival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on y little cap that has lace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.52#A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have nderstood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively and natural oice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked, she laughed oftly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.53#“Well,” resumed the nun, “now that you are happy, mind me, and do not talk ny more.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.54#Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: “Yes, lie own again; be good, for you are going to have your child; Sister Simplice is ight; every one here is right.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.56#The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would fall nto a doze. Between seven and eight o’clock the doctor came; not hearing any ound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, and approached the bed on iptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by the light of the taper, he saw antine’s big eyes gazing at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.57#She said to him, “She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed, ill she not, sir?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.58#The doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.60#The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to him; hat M.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.6.61#He returned to Fantine’s bed, and she went on:—

He rossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow lleys where he lost his way. A citizen was passing along with a lantern.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.8.1#Although he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed a sort f celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled he whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed the confines of a small istrict and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring epartments. Besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by esuscitating the black jet industry, there was not one out of the hundred and orty communes of the arrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him or some benefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the ndustries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when occasion ffered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at Boulogne, he flax-spinning industry at Frévent, and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at oubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with eneration. Arras and Douai envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its ayor.

When the sher, discreetly opening the door which connected the council-chamber with the ourt-room, bent over the back of the President’s armchair and handed him the aper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused, adding: “The entleman desires to be present at the trial,” the President, with a quick and eferential movement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the aper and returned it to the usher, saying, “Admit him.”

In the midst of his reverie he heard some one saying to him, “Will Monsieur o me the honor to follow me?” It was the same usher who had turned his back pon him but a moment previously, and who was now bowing to the earth before im. At the same time, the usher handed him the paper. He unfolded it, and as he hanced to be near the light, he could read it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.8.7#A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet f severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a table with a green loth. The last words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ars: “Monsieur, you are now in the council-chamber; you have only to turn the opper handle of yonder door, and you will find yourself in the court-room, ehind the President’s chair.” These words were mingled in his thoughts with a ague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently raversed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.8.8#The usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He sought to ollect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment when there is he greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life, that the hreads of thought snap within the brain. He was in the very place where the udges deliberated and condemned. With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this eaceful and terrible apartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was oon to ring with his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing. He tared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should be that hamber and that it should be he.

Any spectator who had chanced to ee him at that moment, and who had watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, hat this letter struck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes from t, and he read it two or three times. He read it without paying any attention o it, and unconsciously. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.

He had almost forgotten hat door.

He was no longer in that chamber; he was outside n a corridor, a long, narrow corridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all orts of angles, lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper f invalids, the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he istened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as though ursued.

This man, s the reader already knows, was a vagabond who had been found in a field arrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken in the orchard of a neighbor, alled the Pierron orchard. Who was this man? an examination had been made; itnesses had been heard, and they were unanimous; light had abounded throughout he entire debate; the accusation said: “We have in our grasp not only a arauder, a stealer of fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old ffender who has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most angerous description, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long een in search of, and who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys at oulon, committed a highway robbery, accompanied by violence, on the person of a hild, a Savoyard named Little Gervais; a crime provided for by article 383 of he Penal Code, the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter, when his dentity shall have been judicially established. He has just committed a fresh heft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for the fresh deed; later n he will be judged for the old crime.” In the face of this accusation, in the ace of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to be astonished ore than anything else; he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey o, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, replied with mbarrassment, but his whole person, from head to foot, was a denial; he was an diot in the presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him, nd like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon im; nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future for him; the ikeness increased every moment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more nxiety than he did himself, that sentence freighted with calamity, which escended ever closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of a possibility fforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, in case his identity ere established, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end thereafter in ondemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his apathy? was it mbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at ll? these were questions which divided the crowd, and seemed to divide the ury; there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case: the drama was ot only melancholy; it was also obscure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.9.22#The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that provincial ongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar, and which was ormerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as at Romorantin or at ontbrison, and which to-day, having become classic, is no longer spoken except y the official orators of magistracy, to whom it is suited on account of its rave sonorousness and its majestic stride; a tongue in which a husband is alled _a consort_, and a woman _a spouse_; Paris, _the centre of art and ivilization_; the king, _the monarch_; Monseigneur the Bishop, _a sainted ontiff_; the district-attorney, _the eloquent interpreter of public rosecution_; the arguments, _the accents which we have just listened to_; the ge of Louis XIV., _the grand age_; a theatre, _the temple of Melpomene_; the eigning family, _the august blood of our kings_; a concert, _a musical olemnity_; the General Commandant of the province, _the illustrious warrior, ho, etc._; the pupils in the seminary, _these tender levities_; errors imputed o newspapers, _the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of hose organs_; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as to he theft of the apples,—an awkward matter couched in fine style; but Bénigne ossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral ration, and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion. The awyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been ircumstantially proved. His client, whom he, in his character of counsel, ersisted in calling Champmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor reaking that branch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which the awyer preferred to call a _bough_) in his possession; but he said that he had ound it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up. Where was here any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had been broken off and oncealed after the scaling of the wall, then thrown away by the alarmed arauder; there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case. But what roof was there that that thief had been Champmathieu? One thing only. His haracter as an ex-convict. The lawyer did not deny that that character appeared o be, unhappily, well attested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the ccused had exercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of hampmathieu might well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was rue,—in short, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and without esitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this testimony, he counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client, the denial of an nterested party; but supposing that he was the convict Jean Valjean, did that rove that he was the thief of the apples? that was a presumption at the most, ot a proof. The prisoner, it was true, and his counsel, “in good faith,” was bliged to admit it, had adopted “a bad system of defence.” He obstinately enied everything, the theft and his character of convict. An admission upon his last point would certainly have been better, and would have won for him the ndulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do this; but the ccused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that he would save verything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but ought not the paucity of his intelligence to be taken into consideration? This man was visibly stupid. ong-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside the galleys, had rutalized him, etc. He defended himself badly; was that a reason for condemning im? As for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it; it id not enter into the case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the ourt, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to be evident, to apply o him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his an, and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty f a second offence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.9.23#The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was violent nd florid, as district-attorneys usually are.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.9.24#He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his “loyalty,” and kilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused through all the oncessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admit that the risoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this man was Jean Valjean. his point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed. ere, by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes f crime, the district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic chool, then dawning under the name of _the Satanic school_, which had been estowed upon it by the critics of the _Quotidienne_ and the _Oriflamme_; he ttributed, not without some probability, to the influence of this perverse iterature the crime of Champmathieu, or rather, to speak more correctly, of ean Valjean. Having exhausted these considerations, he passed on to Jean aljean himself. Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a onster spewed forth, etc. The model for this sort of description is contained n the tale of Théramène, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day enders great services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury shuddered.” The description finished, the district-attorney resumed with an ratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the refecture to the highest pitch on the following day: And it is such a man, tc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means of existence, etc., etc., nured by his past life to culpable deeds, and but little reformed by his ojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the crime committed against Little ervais, etc., etc.; it is such a man, caught upon the highway in the very act f theft, a few paces from a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his and the object stolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; enies everything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundred other roofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognize him—Javert, the pright inspector of police; Javert, and three of his former companions in nfamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille. What does he offer in pposition to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will o justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was peaking, the accused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in hich some admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that a an could talk like that. From time to time, at those “energetic” moments of the rosecutor’s speech, when eloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a lood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm, he moved his ead slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and elancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of he argument. Two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard im say in a low voice, “That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup.” The istrict-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude, vidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but craft, skill, a habit of eceiving justice, and which set forth in all its nakedness the “profound erversity” of this man. He ended by making his reserves on the affair of Little ervais and demanding a severe sentence.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.4#This time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motion like man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared at the audience, he gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid his monstrous fist on the im of woodwork in front of his bench, took another look, and all at once, ixing his glance upon the district-attorney, he began to speak. It was like an ruption. It seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his outh,—incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,—as though hey were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.5#“This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris, and hat it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the wheelwright’s trade ne works always in the open air, in courtyards, under sheds when the masters re good, never in closed workshops, because space is required, you see. In inter one gets so cold that one beats one’s arms together to warm one’s self; ut the masters don’t like it; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there s ice between the paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly. One s old while he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man is done for. was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean! When a an is no longer young, they call him nothing but an old bird, old beast! I was ot earning more than thirty sous a day. They paid me as little as possible. The asters took advantage of my age—and then I had my daughter, who was a laundress t the river. She earned a little also. It sufficed for us two. She had trouble, lso; all day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind uts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; you must still wash. There re people who have not much linen, and wait until late; if you do not wash, you ose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and water drops on you from verywhere; you have your petticoats all damp above and below. That penetrates. he has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes hrough faucets. You are not in the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front f you, and rinse in a basin behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not so cold; ut there is that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She ame home at seven o’clock in the evening, and went to bed at once, she was so ired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have not been very happy. She was a ood girl, who did not go to the ball, and who was very peaceable. I remember ne Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at eight o’clock. There, I am telling he truth; you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. Who nows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. Go see at M. aloup’s; and after all, I don’t know what is wanted of me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.6#The man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these things in loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness. nce he paused to salute some one in the crowd. The sort of affirmations which e seemed to fling out before him at random came like hiccoughs, and to each he dded the gesture of a wood-cutter who is splitting wood. When he had finished, he audience burst into a laugh. He stared at the public, and, perceiving that hey were laughing, and not understanding why, he began to laugh himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.7#It was inauspicious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.8#The President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.9#He reminded “the gentlemen of the jury” that “the sieur Baloup, formerly a aster-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had served, had been ummoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, and was not to be found.” Then turning o the accused, he enjoined him to listen to what he was about to say, and dded: “You are in a position where reflection is necessary. The gravest resumptions rest upon you, and may induce vital results. Prisoner, in your own nterests, I summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two oints. In the first place, did you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierron rchard, break the branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, commit the rime of breaking in and theft? In the second place, are you the discharged onvict, Jean Valjean—yes or no?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.10#The prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who has horoughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make. He opened is mouth, turned towards the President, and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.13#“Prisoner,” said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; “pay attention. ou are not answering anything that has been asked of you.

It is evident that your name is not Champmathieu; that you are the onvict, Jean Valjean, concealed first under the name of Jean Mathieu, which was he name of his mother; that you went to Auvergne; that you were born at averolles, where you were a pruner of trees. It is evident that you have been uilty of entering, and of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. he gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.14#The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when the istrict-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.15#“You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could not ind words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who does not have omething to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I was walking through the ountry after a shower, which had made the whole country yellow: even the ponds ere overflowed, and nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades f grass at the wayside. I found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I icked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have een in prison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three months; ore than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell me, ‘Answer!’ The endarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and says to me in a low voice, Come, answer!’ I don’t know how to explain; I have no education; I am a poor an; that is where they wrong me, because they do not see this. I have not tolen; I picked up from the ground things that were lying there. You say, Jean aljean, Jean Mathieu! I don’t know those persons; they are villagers. I worked or M. Baloup, Boulevard de l’Hôpital; my name is Champmathieu. You are very lever to tell me where I was born; I don’t know myself: it’s not everybody who as a house in which to come into the world; that would be too convenient. I hink that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways; I now nothing different. When I was a child, they called me _young fellow_; now hey call me _old Fellow_; those are my baptismal names; take that as you like. have been in Auvergne; I have been at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can’t a man ave been in Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I ell you that I have not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I have been ith M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry me with your nonsense, here! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.16#The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the resident:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.17#“Monsieur le Président, in view of the confused but exceedingly clever enials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an idiot, but who ill not succeed in so doing,—we shall attend to that,—we demand that it shall lease you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this lace the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, and Chenildieu, and Police-Inspector avert, and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner ith the convict Jean Valjean.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.18#“I would remind the district-attorney,” said the President, “that olice-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring rrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as he had made his eposition; we have accorded him permission, with the consent of the istrict-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.19#“That is true, Mr. President,” responded the district-attorney. “In the bsence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury f what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable man, who does honor y his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions. These re the terms of his deposition: ‘I do not even stand in need of circumstantial roofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner’s denial. I ecognize him perfectly. The name of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an x-convict named Jean Valjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared. It is nly with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. He nderwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five or six ttempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from the Pierron rchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of His Grace the late ishop of D—— I often saw him at the time when I was adjutant of the alley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that I recognize him erfectly.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.20#This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression on he public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by insisting, that n default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille hould be heard once more and solemnly interrogated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.21#The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later, the oor of the witnesses’ room opened. The usher, accompanied by a gendarme ready o lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict Brevet. The audience was in uspense; and all breasts heaved as though they had contained but one soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.22#The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central risons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort of business an’s face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes go together. In prison, hither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had become something in the nature of a urnkey. He was a man of whom his superiors said, “He tries to make himself of se.” The chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits. It must not e forgotten that this passed under the Restoration.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.23#“Brevet,” said the President, “you have undergone an ignominious sentence, nd you cannot take an oath.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.24#Brevet dropped his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.25#“Nevertheless,” continued the President, “even in the man whom the law has egraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a sentiment of onor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that I appeal at this decisive our. If it still exists in you,—and I hope it does,—reflect before replying to e: consider on the one hand, this man, whom a word from you may ruin; on the ther hand, justice, which a word from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; here is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken. Rise, risoner. Brevet, take a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and ell us on your soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as our former companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.26#Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.27#“Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to it; hat man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left in 1815. I eft a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it must be because age has rutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I recognize him positively.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.28#“Take your seat,” said the President. “Prisoner, remain standing.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.29#Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by his ed cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at the galleys of oulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was a small man of about ifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced, feverish, who had a sort of ickly feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person, and an immense force n his glance. His companions in the galleys had nicknamed him _I-deny-God_ _Je-nie Dieu_, Chenildieu).
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.30#The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used to revet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which deprived him of he right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his head and looked the crowd in he face. The President invited him to reflection, and asked him as he had asked revet, if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.31#Chenildieu burst out laughing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.32#“Pardieu, as if I didn’t recognize him! We were attached to the same chain or five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.33#“Go take your seat,” said the President.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.34#The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who had ome from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was a peasant rom Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded the flocks among he mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand. Cochepaille as no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner. He was one of hose wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts, and on whom ociety puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.35#The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words, and sked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, without hesitation or rouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.36#“He is Jean Valjean,” said Cochepaille. “He was even called ean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.37#Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and in ood faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the risoner,—a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh eclaration was added to the proceeding.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.38#The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was, ccording to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the first, the endarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his teeth: “Ah, well, e’s a nice one!” after the second, he said, a little louder, with an air that as almost that of satisfaction, “Good!” at the third, he cried, “Famous!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.39#The President addressed him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.40#“Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.43#An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the jury; t was evident that the man was lost.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.44#“Ushers,” said the President, “enforce silence! I am going to sum up the rguments.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.45#At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice was eard crying:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.10.47#All who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible was it; ll eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man, placed among he privileged spectators who were seated behind the court, had just risen, had ushed open the half-door which separated the tribunal from the audience, and as standing in the middle of the hall; the President, the district-attorney, M. amatabois, twenty persons, recognized him, and exclaimed in concert:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.1#It was he, in fact. The clerk’s lamp illumined his countenance. He held his at in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat was carefully uttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; his hair, which had still een gray on his arrival in Arras, was now entirely white: it had turned white uring the hour he had sat there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.2#All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was a omentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so heart-rending; the an who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first. They sked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry; they could not believe hat that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.3#This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President and he district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and the gendarmes ould make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at that moment, M. adeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille, Brevet, and henildieu.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.7#Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been followed y a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall experienced that sort f religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.8#In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy and adness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and a few ow-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public, and asked in ccents which all understood:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.9#“Is there a physician present?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.10#The district-attorney took the word:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.11#“Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident which isturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a sentiment which t is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, by reputation at least, the onorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.; if there is a physician in the udience, we join the President in requesting him to attend to M.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.12#M. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he interrupted im in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the words which he ttered; here they are literally, as they were written down, immediately after he trial by one of the witnesses to this scene, and as they now ring in the ars of those who heard them nearly forty years ago:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.13#“I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see; you ere on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I am fulfilling duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one here who sees the matter learly, and I am telling you the truth. God, who is on high, looks down on what am doing at this moment, and that suffices. You can take me, for here I am: ut I have done my best; I concealed myself under another name; I have become ich; I have become a mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. t seems that that is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I annot tell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will hear it ne of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it is true that robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you that Jean Valjean was a ery vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogether his fault. Listen, honorable udges! a man who has been so greatly humbled as I have has neither any emonstrances to make to Providence, nor any advice to give to society; but, you ee, the infamy from which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing; the alleys make the convict what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before oing to the galleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little intelligence, a ort of idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I was stupid; I became icious: I was a block of wood; I became a firebrand. Later on, indulgence and indness saved me, as severity had ruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot nderstand what I am saying. You will find at my house, among the ashes in the ireplace, the forty-sou piece which I stole, seven years ago, from Little ervais. I have nothing farther to add; take me. Good God! the district-attorney hakes his head; you say, ‘M. Madeleine has gone mad!’ you do not believe me! hat is distressing.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.19#Brevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot with a rightened air. He continued:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.28#In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, nor endarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts. No one ecalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play; the istrict-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting, the resident that he was there to preside, the counsel for the defence that he was here to defend. It was a striking circumstance that no question was put, that o authority intervened. The peculiarity of sublime spectacles is, that they apture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators. No one, probably, could ave explained what he felt; no one, probably, said to himself that he was itnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly azzled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.29#It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That was lear.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.7.11.32#He directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not an arm xtended to hinder him. All stood aside.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.1#The day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish ight, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. Sister Simplice, ho had been watching with her, availed herself of this slumber to go and repare a new potion of chinchona. The worthy sister had been in the laboratory f the infirmary but a few moments, bending over her drugs and phials, and crutinizing things very closely, on account of the dimness which the half-light f dawn spreads over all objects. Suddenly she raised her head and uttered a aint shriek. M. Madeleine stood before her; he had just entered silently.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.2#“Is it you, Mr. Mayor?” she exclaimed.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.6#She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill the ay before, and that she was better now, because she thought that the mayor had one to Montfermeil to get her child. The sister dared not question the mayor; ut she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.7#“All that is good,” said he; “you were right not to undeceive her.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.8#“Yes,” responded the sister; “but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you and will ot see her child. What shall we say to her?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.9#He reflected for a moment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.10#“God will inspire us,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.11#“But we cannot tell a lie,” murmured the sister, half aloud.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.12#It was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M. Madeleine’s ace. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.14#“White!” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.15#Sister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled out he little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient as dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine took the mirror, looked t his hair, and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.16#“Well!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.17#He uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were on omething else.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.18#The sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse n all this.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.19#He inquired:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.26#The nun did not appear to notice this word “perhaps,” which communicated n obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor’s speech. She replied, owering her eyes and her voice respectfully:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.1.28#He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise of which ight awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine’s chamber, approached the ed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Her breath issued from her reast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies, and which reaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside heir sleeping child who is condemned to death. But this painful respiration ardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance, nd which transfigured her in her sleep. Her pallor had become whiteness; her heeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of her youth and er virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though they remained closed and rooping. Her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of ings, all ready to open wide and bear her away, which could be felt as they ustled, though they could not be seen. To see her thus, one would never have reamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of. She esembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the oint of dying.

But while she controlled herself she could not refrain from uestioning M. Madeleine.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.2.30#But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.1#This is what had taken place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.2#The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted the all of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set out again by he mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A little before six o’clock n the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and his first care had been to post letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the infirmary and see Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.3#However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes, hen the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken the word o deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his onvictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident, which ould be explained thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation f that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The istrict-attorney’s persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of very one, of the public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the efence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that, n consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real ean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, and that the ury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawn ome epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., tc.; the President, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, nd in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.4#Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean; and s he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.5#Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the istrict-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred “as to the ecessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.” This phrase, in hich there was a great deal of _of_, is the district-attorney’s, written with is own hand, on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general. His first motion having passed off, the President did not offer many objections. Justice ust, after all, take its course. And then, when all was said, although the resident was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same ime, a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hear he Mayor of M. sur M. say the _Emperor_, and not _Bonaparte_, when alluding to he landing at Cannes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.6#The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The district-attorney orwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at full speed, and entrusted ts execution to Police Inspector Javert.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.9#The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in two ords, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order of arrest, igned by the district-attorney, was couched in these words: “Inspector Javert ill apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M., who, in this ay’s session of the court, was recognized as the liberated convict, Jean aljean.”

He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly mooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual eliberation. Any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him, and who had xamined him attentively at the moment, would have shuddered. The buckle of his eather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This etrayed unwonted agitation.

He stood erect in the half-open door, is hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, which was buttoned p to the chin.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.19#The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all that as in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having been stirred up, ounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in some slight degree, lost he scent, and of having indulged, for a few moments, in an error with regard to hampmathieu, was effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in he first place, and of having for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert’s ontent shone forth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph verspread that narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied ace can afford were there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.3.20#Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly to imself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of is success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, and truth in their elestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and around him, at an nfinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case judged, the legal onscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he was protecting order, he as causing the law to yield up its thunders, he was avenging society, he was ending a helping hand to the absolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a lory. There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, aughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of ferocious archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was ccomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his lenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, ebellion, perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and here was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.

The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his trocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance. Without himself uspecting the fact, Javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied, as is very ignorant man who triumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as his face, wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the ood.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.9#There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words omething indescribably fierce and frenzied. Javert did not say, “Be quick about t!” he said “Bequiabouit.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.10#No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered: it as no longer a human word: it was a roar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.11#He did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into the atter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, Jean Valjean was a sort f mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon, a wrestler in the ark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years, without being able to hrow him. This arrest was not a beginning, but an end. He confined himself to aying, “Be quick about it!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.12#As he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at Jean aljean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and with which he was ccustomed to draw wretches violently to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.13#It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow f her bones two months previously.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.14#At Javert’s exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But the mayor as there; what had she to fear?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.15#Javert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.16#“See here now! Art thou coming?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.17#The unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting the nun nd the mayor. To whom could that abject use of “thou” be addressed? To her nly. She shuddered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.18#Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedented that othing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest deliriums of ever.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.19#She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; she saw he mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was coming to an nd.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.20#Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.21#“Monsieur le Maire!” shrieked Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.22#Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all is gums.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.23#“There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.24#Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the ollar of his coat. He said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.25#“Javert—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.26#Javert interrupted him: “Call me Mr. Inspector.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.27#“Monsieur,” said Jean Valjean, “I should like to say a word to you in rivate.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.28#“Aloud! Say it aloud!” replied Javert; “people are in the habit of talking loud to me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.29#Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.30#“I have a request to make of you—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.31#“I tell you to speak loud.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.32#“But you alone should hear it—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.33#“What difference does that make to me? I shall not listen.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.34#Jean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low oice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.35#“Grant me three days’ grace! three days in which to go and fetch the child f this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. You shall accompany me f you choose.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.36#“You are making sport of me!” cried Javert. “Come now, I did not think you uch a fool! You ask me to give you three days in which to run away! You say hat it is for the purpose of fetching that creature’s child! Ah! Ah! That’s ood! That’s really capital!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.37#Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.38#“My child!” she cried, “to go and fetch my child! She is not here, then! nswer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! Monsieur Madeleine! onsieur le Maire!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.39#Javert stamped his foot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.40#“And now there’s the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy? It’s pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and where women of the own are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going to change all that; it s high time!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.41#He stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into his grasp ean Valjean’s cravat, shirt and collar:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.42#“I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is no onsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named Jean Valjean! nd I have him in my grasp! That’s what there is!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.43#Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on her tiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazed at avert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to speak; a rattle roceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth chattered; she stretched out er arms in her agony, opening her hands convulsively, and fumbling about her ike a drowning person; then suddenly fell back on her pillow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.44#Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her breast, ith gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.45#She was dead.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.46#Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and opened t as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to Javert:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.47#“You have murdered that woman.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.48#“Let’s have an end of this!” shouted Javert, in a fury; “I am not here to isten to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below; march on nstantly, or you’ll get the thumb-screws!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.49#In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a ecidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed when they ere watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this bed, in a twinkling renched off the head-piece, which was already in a dilapidated condition, an asy matter to muscles like his, grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon, and lanced at Javert. Javert retreated towards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with is bar of iron, walked slowly up to Fantine’s couch. When he arrived there he urned and said to Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.50#“I advise you not to disturb me at this moment.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.51#One thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.52#It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might avail imself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped his cane by he small end, and leaned against the door-post, without removing his eyes from ean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.53#Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and his row on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of Fantine, which ay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed, evidently with no further hought of anything connected with this life. Upon his face and in his attitude here was nothing but inexpressible pity. After a few moments of this meditation e bent towards Fantine, and spoke to her in a low voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.54#What did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say to that oman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heard them. Did the ead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions which are, perhaps, ublime realities. The point as to which there exists no doubt is, that Sister implice, the sole witness of the incident, often said that at the moment that ean Valjean whispered in Fantine’s ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable mile dawn on those pale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement f the tomb.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.55#Jean Valjean took Fantine’s head in both his hands, and arranged it on the illow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the string of her hemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That done, he closed her yes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.56#Fantine’s face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.57#Death, that signifies entrance into the great light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.58#Fantine’s hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean knelt own before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.59#Then he rose, and turned to Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.4.60#“Now,” said he, “I am at your disposal.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.head#CHAPTER V—A SUITABLE TOMB
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.1#Javert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.2#The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, an xtraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannot conceal the act, that at the single word, “He was a convict,” nearly every one deserted im. In less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten, nd he was nothing but a “convict from the galleys.” It is just to add that the etails of what had taken place at Arras were not yet known. All day long onversations like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the own:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.3#“You don’t know? He was a liberated convict!” “Who?” “The mayor.” “Bah! M. adeleine?” “Yes.” “Really?” “His name was not Madeleine at all; he had a rightful name, Béjean, Bojean, Boujean.” “Ah! Good God!” “He has been rrested.” “Arrested!” “In prison, in the city prison, while waiting to be ransferred.” “Until he is transferred!” “He is to be transferred!” “Where is he o be taken?” “He will be tried at the Assizes for a highway robbery which he ommitted long ago.” “Well! I suspected as much. That man was too good, too erfect, too affected. He refused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little camps he came across. I always thought there was some evil history back of all hat.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.4#The “drawing-rooms” particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.5#One old lady, a subscriber to the _Drapeau Blanc_, made the following emark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.6#“I am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.7#It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanished rom M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to is memory. The old portress who had served him was among the number.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.8#On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge, till in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections. The factory had een closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the street was deserted. here was no one in the house but the two nuns, Sister Perpétue and Sister implice, who were watching beside the body of Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.9#Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, the good ortress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of M. Madeleine’s hamber, and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his uarters; then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomed to take it, nd set the candlestick on one side, as though she was expecting him. Then she at down again on her chair, and became absorbed in thought once more. The poor, ood old woman had done all this without being conscious of it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.10#It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from er reverie, and exclaimed, “Hold! My good God Jesus! And I hung his key on the ail!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.11#At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passed hrough, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at the candle hich was burning there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.12#The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and a hriek which she confined to her throat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.13#She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.14#It was M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.15#It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a _seizure_, as she aid herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.16#“Good God, Monsieur le Maire,” she cried at last, “I thought you ere—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.17#She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in espect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire to er.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.18#He finished her thought.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.19#“In prison,” said he. “I was there; I broke a bar of one of the windows; I et myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am going up to my room; o and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with that poor woman, no doubt.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.20#The old woman obeyed in all haste.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.21#He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him better han he should guard himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.22#No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without pening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him, a pass-key which pened a little side-door; but he must have been searched, and his latch-key ust have been taken from him. This point was never explained.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.23#He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the top, e left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door with very ittle noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling, then eturned for his candle and re-entered his room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.24#It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window could e seen from the street.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.25#He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed which ad not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder of the night efore last remained. The portress had “done up” his room; only she had picked ut of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel nd the forty-sou piece which had been blackened by the fire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.26#He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: “These are the two tips of my ron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais, which I entioned at the Court of Assizes,” and he arranged this piece of paper, the its of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be een on entering the room. From a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts, hich he tore in pieces. In the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two ilver candlesticks. He betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was rapping up the Bishop’s candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It as probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.27#This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room hen the authorities made an examination later on.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.28#There came two taps at the door.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.29#“Come in,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.30#It was Sister Simplice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.31#She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled in er hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that however olished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our very bowels, and orce it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of that day had turned the nun nto a woman once more. She had wept, and she was trembling.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.32#Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which he anded to the nun, saying, “Sister, you will give this to Monsieur le Curé.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.33#The paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.34#“You can read it,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.35#She read:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.36#“I beg Monsieur le Curé to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me. He ill be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of the funeral f the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.37#The sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a few narticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.38#“Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor, nhappy woman?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.39#“No,” said he; “I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me in hat room, and that would disturb her.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.40#He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase. hey heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old portress saying in her oudest and most piercing tones:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.41#“My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has entered his house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not even left the oor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.42#A man responded:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.43#“But there is a light in that room, nevertheless.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.44#They recognized Javert’s voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.45#The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner of he wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed himself in his angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.46#The door opened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.47#Javert entered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.48#The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were udible in the corridor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.49#The nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.50#The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.51#Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.52#It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element, he very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority. This was mpregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor restriction. In his eyes, of ourse, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all; he was religious, uperficial and correct on this point as on all others. In his eyes, a priest as a mind, who never makes a mistake; a nun was a creature who never sins; they ere souls walled in from this world, with a single door which never opened xcept to allow the truth to pass through.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.53#On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.54#But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him mperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to remain and to enture on at least one question.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.55#This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javert new it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.56#“Sister,” said he, “are you alone in this room?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.57#A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as though he should faint.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.58#The sister raised her eyes and answered:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.59#“Yes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.60#“Then,” resumed Javert, “you will excuse me if I persist; it is my duty; ou have not seen a certain person—a man—this evening? He has escaped; we are in earch of him—that Jean Valjean; you have not seen him?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.61#The sister replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.62#“No.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.63#She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, without esitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing herself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.64#“Pardon me,” said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.65#O sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoined your isters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light; may this lie e counted to your credit in paradise!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.66#The sister’s affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he did ot even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been xtinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.67#An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly departing rom M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean Valjean. It has been stablished by the testimony of two or three carters who met him, that he was arrying a bundle; that he was dressed in a blouse. Where had he obtained that louse? No one ever found out. But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of he factory a few days before, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. erhaps that was the one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.68#One last word about Fantine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.69#We all have a mother,—the earth. Fantine was given back to that other.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.70#The curé thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, in eserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left for the oor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the town. That is hy he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced it to that strictly ecessary form known as the pauper’s grave.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:1.8.5.71#So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to nybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God knows where o find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade, among the first bones hat came to hand; she was subjected to the promiscuousness of ashes. She was hrown into the public grave. Her grave resembled her bed.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.1.1#Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who s telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his course owards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved road, which ndulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which succeed each other, aise the road and let it fall again, and produce something in the nature of normous waves.

He ad just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and at the angle of the crossroad, y the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription _Ancient Barrier o. 4_, a public house, bearing on its front this sign: _At the Four Winds_ (Aux uatre Vents). _Échabeau, Private Café_.

The clump of sparsely planted but very green trees, hich fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed over the meadows on he other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in the direction of raine-l’Alleud.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.1.4#On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart at he door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwood near flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder suspended along n old penthouse with straw partitions. A young girl was weeding in a field, here a huge yellow poster, probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish estival, was fluttering in the wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in hich a flotilla of ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the ushes. The wayfarer struck into this.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.1.5#After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth century, urmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he found himself efore a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear impost, in the sombre tyle of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat medallions. A severe façade rose above his door; a wall, perpendicular to the façade, almost touched the door, and lanked it with an abrupt right angle. In the meadow before the door lay three arrows, through which, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was losed. The two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old usty knocker.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.1.6#The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May, which eems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A brave little bird, robably a lover, was carolling in a distracted manner in a large tree.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.1#Hougomont,—this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle, the irst resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, called Napoleon, ncountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of his axe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.2#It was a château; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the antiquary, ougomont is _Hugomons_. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire of Somerel, the same ho endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of Villiers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.3#The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under the orch, and entered the courtyard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.4#The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the ixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else having fallen rostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its birth in ruin. In a wall ear the arcade opens another arched door, of the time of Henry IV., permitting glimpse of the trees of an orchard; beside this door, a manure-hole, some ickaxes, some shovels, some carts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron eel, a chicken jumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by small bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against the wall f the chapel—behold the court, the conquest of which was one of Napoleon’s reams. This corner of earth, could he but have seized it, would, perhaps, have iven him the world likewise. Chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their eaks. A growl is audible; it is a huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces he English.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.5#The English behaved admirably there. Cooke’s four companies of guards there eld out for seven hours against the fury of an army.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.6#Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildings nd enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle of which is icked out. It is this angle which contains the southern door, guarded by this all, which commands it only a gun’s length away. Hougomont has two doors,—the outhern door, that of the château; and the northern door, belonging to the arm. Napoleon sent his brother Jérôme against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, uilleminot, and Bachelu hurled themselves against it; nearly the entire corps f Reille was employed against it, and miscarried; Kellermann’s balls were xhausted on this heroic section of wall. Bauduin’s brigade was not strong nough to force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do ore than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without taking t.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.7#The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the north oor, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It consists of four lanks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars of the attack are isible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.8#The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had a iece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, stands half-open t the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall, built of stone elow, of brick above which closes in the courtyard on the north. It is a simple oor for carts, such as exist in all farms, with the two large leaves made of ustic planks: beyond lie the meadows. The dispute over this entrance was urious. For a long time, all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on he door-posts. It was there that Bauduin was killed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.9#The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror is isible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives and it ies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death agony, the stones all; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds; the drooping, quivering rees seem to be making an effort to flee.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.10#This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildings hich have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.11#The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in, but ould not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the château, the nly ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in a crumbling tate,—disembowelled, one might say. The château served for a dungeon, the hapel for a block-house. There men exterminated each other. The French, fired n from every point,—from behind the walls, from the summits of the garrets, rom the depths of the cellars, through all the casements, through all the ir-holes, through every crack in the stones,—fetched fagots and set fire to alls and men; the reply to the grape-shot was a conflagration.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.12#In the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, the ismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; the English uards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the staircase, cracked from he ground floor to the very roof, appears like the inside of a broken shell. he staircase has two stories; the English, besieged on the staircase, and assed on its upper steps, had cut off the lower steps. These consisted of large labs of blue stone, which form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps till cling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. These naccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles a jaw which as been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there: one is dead; the ther is wounded at its base, and is clothed with verdure in April. Since 1815 t has taken to growing through the staircase.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.13#A massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recovered its alm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since the carnage. evertheless, the altar has been left there—an altar of unpolished wood, placed gainst a background of roughhewn stone. Four whitewashed walls, a door opposite he altar, two small arched windows; over the door a large wooden crucifix, elow the crucifix a square air-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the round, in one corner, an old window-frame with the glass all broken to ieces—such is the chapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of aint Anne, of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been arried off by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for a oment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this uilding; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was burned, he wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed upon his feet, of which only he blackened stumps are now to be seen; then it stopped,—a miracle, according o the assertion of the people of the neighborhood. The infant Jesus, ecapitated, was less fortunate than the Christ.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.14#The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this name s to be read: _Henquinez_. Then these others: _Conde de Rio Maior Marques y arquesa de Almagro (Habana)_. There are French names with exclamation points,—a ign of wrath. The wall was freshly whitewashed in 1849. The nations insulted ach other there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.15#It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which held n axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.16#On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are two n this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley to this? It s because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not drawn there? Because t is full of skeletons.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.17#The last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume van ylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener there. On the 8th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves in the woods.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.18#The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunate eople who had been scattered abroad, for many days and nights. There are at his day certain traces recognizable, such as old boles of burned trees, which ark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the depths of the hickets.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.19#Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, “to guard the château,” and oncealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there. They tore him rom his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve hem, by administering blows with the flats of their swords. They were thirsty; his Guillaume brought them water. It was from this well that he drew it. Many rank there their last draught. This well where drank so many of the dead was estined to die itself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.20#After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Death as a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to follow glory. The yphus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, and it was turned into a epulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast into it. With too much haste erhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says they were not. It seems that on the ight succeeding the interment, feeble voices were heard calling from the ell.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.21#This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, part tone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded like the eaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side is open. It is here that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless oophole, possibly the hole made by a shell. This little tower had a platform, f which only the beams remain. The iron supports of the well on the right form cross. On leaning over, the eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is illed with a heaped-up mass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the ell is concealed in a growth of nettles.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.22#This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the able for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by a cross-beam, gainst which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood hich resemble huge bones. There is no longer either pail, chain, or pulley; but here is still the stone basin which served the overflow. The rain-water ollects there, and from time to time a bird of the neighboring forests comes hither to drink, and then flies away. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is till inhabited. The door of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, eside a pretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed lanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped this andle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed off his hand ith an axe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.23#The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van ylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said to us: “I as there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older, was terrified and ept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there in my mother’s arms. We lued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated the cannon, and went _boum! oum!_”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.24#A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, so we ere told. The orchard is terrible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.25#It is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The first part s a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These three parts ave a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the buildings of the hâteau and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the right, a wall; and at the nd, a wall. The wall on the right is of brick, the wall at the bottom is of tone. One enters the garden first. It slopes downwards, is planted with ooseberry bushes, choked with a wild growth of vegetation, and terminated by a onumental terrace of cut stone, with balustrade with a double curve.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.26#It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le ôtre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted by globes hich resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters can still be counted n their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass. Almost all bear scratches f bullets. One broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured eg.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.27#It was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that six ight-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and being unable o escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens, accepted the combat ith two Hanoverian companies, one of which was armed with carbines. The anoverians lined this balustrade and fired from above. The infantry men, eplying from below, six against two hundred, intrepid and with no shelter save he currant-bushes, took a quarter of an hour to die.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.28#One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard, roperly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square fathoms, fifteen undred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems ready to renew the combat. hirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the English at irregular heights, are there till. In front of the sixth are placed two English tombs of granite. There are oopholes only in the south wall, as the principal attack came from that uarter. The wall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge; the French came up, hinking that they had to deal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found the wall oth an obstacle and an ambuscade, with the English guards behind it, the hirty-eight loopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot and balls, and oye’s brigade was broken against it. Thus Waterloo began.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.29#Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the French caled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees. All this rass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven hundred strong, was verwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against which Kellermann’s two atteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.2.30#This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has its uttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses browse here; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the spaces between the rees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one walks over this uncultivated and, and one’s foot dives into mole-holes. In the middle of the grass one bserves an uprooted tree-bole which lies there all verdant. Major Blackmann eaned against it to die. Beneath a great tree in the neighborhood fell the erman general, Duplat, descended from a French family which fled on the evocation of the Edict of Nantes. An aged and falling apple-tree leans far over o one side, its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam. early all the apple-trees are falling with age. There is not one which has not ad its bullet or its biscayan.6 The skeletons of dead trees abound in this rchard. Crows fly through their branches, and at the end of it is a wood full f violets.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.3.2#If it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of June, 815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few drops of water, more r less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that Providence required in order o make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz was a little more rain, and a cloud raversing the sky out of season sufficed to make a world crumble.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.3.3#The battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleven o’clock, nd that gave Blücher time to come up. Why? Because the ground was wet. The rtillery had to wait until it became a little firmer before they could anœuvre.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.3.4#Napoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. The oundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report to the irectory on Aboukir, said: _Such a one of our balls killed six men_. All his lans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to his victory was to ake the artillery converge on one point. He treated the strategy of the hostile eneral like a citadel, and made a breach in it. He overwhelmed the weak point ith grape-shot; he joined and dissolved battles with cannon. There was omething of the sharpshooter in his genius. To beat in squares, to pulverize egiments, to break lines, to crush and disperse masses,—for him everything lay n this, to strike, strike, strike incessantly,—and he intrusted this task to he cannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius, endered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of ifteen years.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.3.5#On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery, because e had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred and fifty-nine ouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.

Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.3.7#Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated this epoch y an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war worn out the blade s it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body? Did the veteran make imself disastrously felt in the leader? In a word, was this genius, as many istorians of note have thought, suffering from an eclipse? Did he go into a renzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself? Did he begin to aver under the delusion of a breath of adventure? Had he become—a grave matter n a general—unconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class of material reat men, who may be called the giants of action, when genius grows hort-sighted? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal; for the Dantes nd Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness; is it to grow less for he Hannibals and the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon lost the direct sense of victory? ad he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could no onger divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had e lost his power of scenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days known ll the roads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning, ointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that state of inister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it, to he precipice?

The left limb of the A is he road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe, the tie of the A is he hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l’Alleud. The top of the A is ont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tip is Hougomont, where eille is stationed with Jérôme Bonaparte; the right tip is the Belle-Alliance, here Napoleon was. At the centre of this chord is the precise point where the inal word of the battle was pronounced. It was there that the lion has been laced, the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.4.2#The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and the ie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean.

The one seeks to trip up the other. hey clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support; an angle of the wall ffers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack of a hovel under whose cover hey can draw up, a regiment yields its ground; an unevenness in the ground, a hance turn in the landscape, a cross-path encountered at the right moment, a rove, a ravine, can stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army, and revent its retreat.

That calm profile under he little three-cornered hat of the school of Brienne, that green uniform, the hite revers concealing the star of the Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding is epaulets, the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his eather trousers, the white horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing n the corners crowned N’s and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver purs, the sword of Marengo,—that whole figure of the last of the Cæsars is resent to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severely egarded by others.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.4.8#That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from a ertain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and which always eils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day history and daylight ave arrived.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.4.9#That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar and ivine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it is wholly ight, it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto beheld rays; rom the same man it constructs two different phantoms, and the one attacks the ther and executes justice on it, and the shadows of the despot contend with the rilliancy of the leader. Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive udgments of nations. Babylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens æsar, Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a isfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.1#Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a beginning hich was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both armies, but still ore so for the English than for the French.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.2#It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, the ater had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if in casks; t some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried up to the axles, he circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid mud. If the wheat and rye rampled down by this cohort of transports on the march had not filled in the uts and strewn a litter beneath the wheels, all movement, particularly in the alleys, in the direction of Papelotte would have been impossible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.3#The affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in the abit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol, aiming it now at ne point, now at another, of the battle; and it had been his wish to wait until he horse batteries could move and gallop freely. In order to do that it was ecessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil. But the sun did not ake its appearance. It was no longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the irst cannon was fired, the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and oted that it was thirty-five minutes past eleven.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.4#The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the Emperor ould have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on Hougomont. At the ame time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling Quiot’s brigade on La aie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right wing of the French against the eft wing of the English, which rested on Papelotte.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.5#The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to draw ellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan would have ucceeded if the four companies of the English guards and the brave Belgians of erponcher’s division had not held the position solidly, and Wellington, instead f massing his troops there, could confine himself to despatching thither, as einforcements, only four more companies of guards and one battalion from runswick.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.6#The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated, in act, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels, to bar the assage against possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington ack on Hougomont, thence on Braine-l’Alleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. ith the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded. Papelotte was aken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.7#A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly in empt’s brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers were valiant in he presence of our redoubtable infantry; their inexperience extricated them ntrepidly from the dilemma; they performed particularly excellent service as kirmishers: the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, so to peak, his own general. These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity nd fury. This novice of an infantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.8#After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.9#There is in this day an obscure interval, from midday to four o’clock; the iddle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and participates in the ombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it. We perceive ast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernalia of war almost nknown to-day, pendant colbacks, floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, artridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand rinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of runswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers ith great, white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, he Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, with brass ands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids, the reat white gaiters of our grenadiers; pictures, not strategic lines—what alvator Rosa requires, not what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.10#A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. _Quid bscurum, quid divinum_. Each historian traces, to some extent, the particular eature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever may be the combinations f the generals, the shock of armed masses has an incalculable ebb. During the ction the plans of the two leaders enter into each other and become mutually hrown out of shape. Such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants han such another, just as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less uickly the water which is poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more oldiers than one would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. he line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of blood gush llogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments form capes and gulfs s they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are continually moving in front of ach other. Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives, the cavalry rushes n where the artillery was, the battalions are like smoke. There was something here; seek it. It has disappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre olds advance and retreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, urls back, distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an scillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute, not a ay. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those powerful ainters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is better than Vandermeulen; andermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three o’clock. Geometry is deceptive; the urricane alone is trustworthy. That is what confers on Folard the right to ontradict Polybius. Let us add, that there is a certain instant when the battle egenerates into a combat, becomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable etailed feats, which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, “belong ather to the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army.” The istorian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He cannot do ore than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, and it is not given to ny one narrator, however conscientious he may be, to fix, absolutely, the form f that horrible cloud which is called a battle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.5.11#This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularly pplicable to Waterloo.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.head#CHAPTER VI—FOUR O’CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.1#Towards four o’clock the condition of the English army was serious. The rince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing, Picton of he left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, shouted to the ollando-Belgians: “Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!” Hill, having been eakened, had come up to the support of Wellington; Picton was dead. At the very oment when the English had captured from the French the flag of the 105th of he line, the French had killed the English general, Picton, with a bullet hrough the head. The battle had, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont nd La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte as taken. Of the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men urvived; all the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three housand combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English uards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his companions, ad been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring had been dislodged, lten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost, one from Alten’s division, and ne from the battalion of Lunenburg, carried by a prince of the house of eux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no longer existed; Ponsonby’s great dragoons had een hacked to pieces. That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro nd beneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six undred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the arth,—Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by seven ance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the ixth, had been annihilated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.2#Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but one allying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellington reinforced t. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he summoned Chassé, who as at Braine-l’Alleud.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.3#The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and very ompact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, having ehind it the village, and in front of it the slope, which was tolerably steep hen. It rested on that stout stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the omain of Nivelles, and which marks the intersection of the roads—a pile of the ixteenth century, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without njuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here and here, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of a cannon etween two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery was ambushed in the rushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorized by war, which permits raps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had been despatched by the Emperor at ine o’clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy’s batteries, had discovered othing of it, and had returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no bstacles except the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to enappe. It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau battalion of Kempt’s brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, was concealed in he tall wheat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.4#Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was well osted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes, then adjoining he field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of Groenendael and Boitsfort. n army could not retreat thither without dissolving; the regiments would have roken up immediately there. The artillery would have been lost among the orasses. The retreat, according to many a man versed in the art,—though it is isputed by others,—would have been a disorganized flight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.5#To this centre, Wellington added one of Chassé‘s brigades taken from the ight wing, and one of Wincke’s brigades taken from the left wing, plus linton’s division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to the brigades f Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as reinforcements and aids, the nfantry of Brunswick, Nassau’s contingent, Kielmansegg’s Hanoverians, and mpteda’s Germans. This placed twenty-six battalions under his hand. _The right ing_, as Charras says, _was thrown back on the centre_. An enormous battery was asked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the Museum of Waterloo.” Besides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, omerset’s Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the remaining alf of the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset emained.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.6#The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, was anged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bags of sand nd a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there had been no time o make a palisade for it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.7#Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained the hole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill of ont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, which an nglishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for two hundred francs, ut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly heroic. The bullets rained bout him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at his side. Lord Hill, pointing to a hell which had burst, said to him: “My lord, what are your orders in case you re killed?” “To do like me,” replied Wellington. To Clinton he said aconically, “To hold this spot to the last man.” The day was evidently turning ut ill. Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of alamanca: “Boys, can retreat be thought of? Think of old England!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.6.8#Towards four o’clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing was isible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters; he rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by the shells and the French ullets, retreated into the bottom, now intersected by the back road of the farm f Mont-Saint-Jean; a retrograde movement took place, the English front hid tself, Wellington drew back. “The beginning of retreat!” cried Napoleon.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.1#The Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble, ad never been in a better humor than on that day. His impenetrability had been miling ever since the morning. On the 18th of June, that profound soul masked y marble beamed blindly. The man who had been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at aterloo. The greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes. Our joys are composed f shadow. The supreme smile is God’s alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.2#_Ridet Cæsar, Pompeius flebit_, said the legionaries of the Fulminatrix egion. Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it is certain that æsar laughed. While exploring on horseback at one o’clock on the preceding ight, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand, the communes in the eighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of the long line of the English amp-fires illuminating the whole horizon from Frischemont to Braine-l’Alleud, t had seemed to him that fate, to whom he had assigned a day on the field of aterloo, was exact to the appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for ome time motionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder; and his fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying, “We re in accord.” Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longer in accord.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.3#He took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was marked by a oy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts, halting here and here to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, near the wood of Hougomont, he eard the tread of a column on the march; he thought at the moment that it was a etreat on the part of Wellington. He said: “It is the rear-guard of the English etting under way for the purpose of decamping. I will take prisoners the six housand English who have just arrived at Ostend.” He conversed expansively; he egained the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March, hen he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf uan, and cried, “Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement already!” On the night f the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. “That little Englishman eeds a lesson,” said Napoleon. The rain redoubled in violence; the thunder olled while the Emperor was speaking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.4#At half-past three o’clock in the morning, he lost one illusion; officers ho had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not aking any movement. Nothing was stirring; not a bivouac-fire had been xtinguished; the English army was asleep. The silence on earth was profound; he only noise was in the heavens. At four o’clock, a peasant was brought in to im by the scouts; this peasant had served as guide to a brigade of English avalry, probably Vivian’s brigade, which was on its way to take up a position n the village of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o’clock, two Belgian eserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment, and that he English army was ready for battle. “So much the better!” exclaimed Napoleon. I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them back.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.5#In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an angle ith the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant’s chair brought to im from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a truss of straw for a arpet, and spread out on the table the chart of the battle-field, saying to oult as he did so, “A pretty checker-board.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.6#In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports of provisions, mbedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by morning; the soldiers ad had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. This did not prevent Napoleon from xclaiming cheerfully to Ney, “We have ninety chances out of a hundred.” At ight o’clock the Emperor’s breakfast was brought to him. He invited many enerals to it. During breakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball wo nights before, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond’s; and Soult, a rough an of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, “The ball takes place to-day.” he Emperor jested with Ney, who said, “Wellington will not be so simple as to ait for Your Majesty.” That was his way, however. “He was fond of jesting,” ays Fleury de Chaboulon. “A merry humor was at the foundation of his haracter,” says Gourgaud. “He abounded in pleasantries, which were more eculiar than witty,” says Benjamin Constant. These gayeties of a giant are orthy of insistence. It was he who called his grenadiers “his grumblers”; he inched their ears; he pulled their moustaches. “The Emperor did nothing but lay pranks on us,” is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip rom the island of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the rench brig of war, _Le Zéphyr_, having encountered the brig _L’Inconstant_, on hich Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon from L’Inconstant_, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine ockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly eized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, “The Emperor is well.” A an who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events. Napoleon indulged in any fits of this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he editated for a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves on the russ of straw, pen in hand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor ictated to them the order of battle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.7#At nine o’clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelons nd set in motion in five columns, had deployed—the divisions in two lines, the rtillery between the brigades, the music at their head; as they beat the march, ith rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a sea f casques, of sabres, and of bayonets on the horizon, the Emperor was touched, nd twice exclaimed, “Magnificent! Magnificent!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.8#Between nine o’clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as it may ppear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines, forming, to epeat the Emperor’s expression, “the figure of six V’s.” A few moments after he formation of the battle-array, in the midst of that profound silence, like hat which heralds the beginning of a storm, which precedes engagements, the mperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, as he beheld the three batteries of welve-pounders, detached by his orders from the corps of Erlon, Reille, and obau, and destined to begin the action by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was ituated at the intersection of the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to im, “There are four and twenty handsome maids, General.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.9#Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed before him, he company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointed to barricade ont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried. All this serenity had een traversed by but a single word of haughty pity; perceiving on his left, at spot where there now stands a large tomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with heir superb horses, massing themselves, he said, “It is a pity.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.10#Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected for his ost of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of the road from enappe to Brussels, which was his second station during the battle. The third tation, the one adopted at seven o’clock in the evening, between La elle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable; it is a rather elevated knoll, hich still exists, and behind which the guard was massed on a slope of the lain. Around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road, up o Napoleon himself. As at Brienne, he had over his head the shriek of the ullets and of the heavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and hapeless projectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his orse’s feet stood. _Scabra rubigine_. A few years ago, a shell of sixty pounds, till charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb, was unearthed. t was at this last post that the Emperor said to his guide, Lacoste, a hostile nd terrified peasant, who was attached to the saddle of a hussar, and who urned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon: Fool, it is shameful! You’ll get yourself killed with a ball in the back.” He ho writes these lines has himself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on urning over the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by the xidization of six and forty years, and old fragments of iron which parted like lder-twigs between the fingers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.11#Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, here the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer hat they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from this mournful field the herewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and istory, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been isfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo nce more, two years later, exclaimed, “They have altered my field of battle!” here the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there as a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but hich was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The levation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two nolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to russels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is n the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre or France. Thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth mployed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in ircumference, the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy lope. On the day of battle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was brupt and difficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the English annon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley, which was he centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains had still farther ncreased this acclivity, the mud complicated the problem of the ascent, and the en not only slipped back, but stuck fast in the mire. Along the crest of the lateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant bserver to divine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.12#What was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l’Alleud is a Belgian illage; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed in curves of he landscape, are connected by a road about a league and a half in length, hich traverses the plain along its undulating level, and often enters and uries itself in the hills like a furrow, which makes a ravine of this road in ome places. In 1815, as at the present day, this road cut the crest of the lateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between the two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; nly, it is now on a level with the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two lopes have been appropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and till is, a trench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow rench, sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep, rumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under driving rains. ccidents happened here. The road was so narrow at the Braine-l’Alleud entrance hat a passer-by was crushed by a cart, as is proved by a stone cross which tands near the cemetery, and which gives the name of the dead, _Monsieur ernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels_, and the date of the accident, _February, 637_.8 It was so deep on the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, athieu Nicaise, was crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is tated on another stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process f clearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the rassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte and the farm of ont-Saint-Jean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.7.13#On the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no way ndicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at the summit of the scarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible; that is to say, errible.

Napoleon was accustomed to gaze teadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending details, cipher by cipher; iphers mattered little to him, provided that they furnished the total—victory; e was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray, since he thought himself the aster and the possessor at the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to e out of the question, and he treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to ate, Thou wilt not dare.

He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted the declivities, crutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the path; he seemed to be ounting each bush. He gazed with some intentness at the English barricades of he two highways,—two large abatis of trees, that on the road to Genappe above a Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannon, the only ones out of all the English rtillery which commanded the extremity of the field of battle, and that on the oad to Nivelles where gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chassé‘s brigade.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.1#There were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed a front a uarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, on colossal horses. There ere six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them to support them efebvre-Desnouettes’s division,—the one hundred and six picked gendarmes, the ight cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred and ninety-seven men, and the lancers f the guard of eight hundred and eighty lances. They wore casques without orse-tails, and cuirasses of beaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, nd long sabre-swords. That morning the whole army had admired them, when, at ine o’clock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing “Let us watch ’er the Safety of the Empire,” they had come in a solid column, with one of heir batteries on their flank, another in their centre, and deployed in two anks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont, and taken up their position or battle in that powerful second line, so cleverly arranged by Napoleon, hich, having on its extreme left Kellermann’s cuirassiers and on its extreme ight Milhaud’s cuirassiers, had, so to speak, two wings of iron.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.2#Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor’s orders. Ney drew his sword nd placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were set in motion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.3#Then a formidable spectacle was seen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.4#All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung to he breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a simultaneous ovement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen battering-ram which is ffecting a breach, the hill of La Belle Alliance, plunged into the terrible epths in which so many men had already fallen, disappeared there in the smoke, hen emerging from that shadow, reappeared on the other side of the valley, till compact and in close ranks, mounting at a full trot, through a storm of rape-shot which burst upon them, the terrible muddy slope of the table-land of ont-Saint-Jean. They ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the ntervals between the musketry and the artillery, their colossal trampling was udible. Being two divisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier’s division eld the right, Delort’s division was on the left. It seemed as though two mmense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the able-land. It traversed the battle like a prodigy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.5#Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of the uskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney was again present. t seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul. Each olumn undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp. They could be seen hrough a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there. A confusion of elmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy heaving of the cruppers of horses amid he cannons and the flourish of trumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; ver all, the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.6#These narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel to his vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which told of the entaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human heads and equestrian hests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible, invulnerable, sublime—gods and easts.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.7#Odd numerical coincidence,—twenty-six battalions rode to meet twenty-six attalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of the masked attery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares, two battalions to he square, in two lines, with seven in the first line, six in the second, the tocks of their guns to their shoulders, taking aim at that which was on the oint of appearing, waited, calm, mute, motionless. They did not see the uirassiers, and the cuirassiers did not see them. They listened to the rise of his flood of men. They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the lternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the uirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing. here ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once, a long file of uplifted rms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the crest, and casques, trumpets, and tandards, and three thousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, “Vive ’Empereur!” All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the ppearance of an earthquake.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.8#All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, the head f the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. On arriving at he culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterly given over to fury and heir course of extermination of the squares and cannon, the cuirassiers had ust caught sight of a trench,—a trench between them and the English. It was the ollow road of Ohain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.9#It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning, irectly under the horses’ feet, two fathoms deep between its double slopes; the econd file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed on the second; the orses reared and fell backward, landed on their haunches, slid down, all four eet in the air, crushing and overwhelming the riders; and there being no means f retreat,—the whole column being no longer anything more than a rojectile,—the force which had been acquired to crush the English crushed the rench; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and riders olled there pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in his gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the rest marched over them nd passed on. Almost a third of Dubois’s brigade fell into that abyss.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.10#This began the loss of the battle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.9.11#A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that two housand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road of Ohain. his figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this avine the day after the combat.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.9#All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenzied hirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The first rank nelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second ranks shot them own; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged their guns, the front of the quare parted, permitted the passage of an eruption of grape-shot, and closed gain. The cuirassiers replied by crushing them. Their great horses reared, trode across the ranks, leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the idst of these four living wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these uirassiers; the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men isappeared, ground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the ellies of these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably ever been seen anywhere else. The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry, closed p their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of grape-shot, hey created explosions in their assailants’ midst. The form of this combat was onstrous. These squares were no longer battalions, they were craters; those uirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were a tempest. Each square was a olcano attacked by a cloud; lava contended with lightning.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.10#The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in the ir, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formed of the 75th egiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centre dropped his melancholy yes, filled with the reflections of the forests and the lakes, in profound nattention, while men were being exterminated around him, and seated on a drum, ith his pibroch under his arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen died hinking of Ben Lothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. The sword of a uirassier, which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end o the song by killing the singer.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.12#All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, found hemselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Before them two quares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the uard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with the German light-horse, and on is left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers; the cuirassiers attacked on the lank and in front, before and in the rear, by infantry and cavalry, had to face ll sides. What mattered it to them? They were a whirlwind. Their valor was omething indescribable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.13#In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was still hundering.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.14#For such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. It was no onger a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzy transport of ouls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In an instant the fourteen undred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred. Fuller, their ieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up with the lancers and efebvre-Desnouettes’s light-horse. The plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean was captured, ecaptured, captured again. The cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the nfantry; or, to put it more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared ach other without releasing the other. The squares still held firm.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.23#The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken hrough. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it, and in act it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellington held the illage and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and the slope. They eemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.24#But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding of that rmy was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded reinforcements. “There are one,” replied Wellington; “he must let himself be killed!” Almost at that same oment, a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies, ey demanded infantry from Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, “Infantry! Where oes he expect me to get it? Does he think I can make it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.10.25#Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The urious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breasts of teel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clustered round a flag arked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalion was commanded only by a aptain or a lieutenant; Alten’s division, already so roughly handled at La aie-Sainte, was almost destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze’s brigade trewed the rye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of hose Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks in 1811, ought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the English standard, ought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was considerable. Lord Uxbridge, ho had his leg buried on the following day, had his knee shattered. If, on the rench side, in that tussle of the cuirassiers, Delort, l’Héritier, Colbert, nop, Travers, and Blancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was lten wounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda illed, the whole of Wellington’s staff decimated, and England had the worse of t in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards had lost five ieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns; the first battalion of he 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200 soldiers; the 79th Highlanders ad lost 24 officers wounded, 18 officers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The anoverian hussars of Cumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its ead, who was destined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in he presence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeat ll the way to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, he wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the French were gaining round and approaching the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch, mowed own by the French cavalry, cried, “Alarm!” From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of Brussels, according to the estimony of eye-witnesses who are still alive, the roads were encumbered with ugitives. This panic was such that it attacked the Prince de Condé at Mechlin, nd Louis XVIII. at Ghent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned ehind the ambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian’s nd Vandeleur’s brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington had no cavalry eft. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. These facts are attested by Siborne; nd Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the nglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke remained alm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austrian commissioner, Alava, the panish commissioner, who were present at the battle in the English staff, hought the Duke lost. At five o’clock Wellington drew out his watch, and he was eard to murmur these sinister words, “Blücher, or night!”

All of a sudden, at that very oment,—it was eight o’clock in the evening—the clouds on the horizon parted, nd allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to pass through, thwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen it rise at Austerlitz.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.12.4#Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this final atastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan, were here. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with their large laques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line, tranquil, in the midst f that combat, the enemy felt a respect for France; they thought they beheld wenty victories entering the field of battle, with wings outspread, and those ho were the conquerors, believing themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but ellington shouted, “Up, Guards, and aim straight!” The red regiment of English uards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot riddled he tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurled themselves orwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, the Imperial Guard felt he army losing ground around it, and in the vast shock of the rout it heard the esperate flight which had taken the place of the “Vive l’Empereur!” and, with light behind it, it continued to advance, more crushed, losing more men at very step that it took. There were none who hesitated, no timid men in its anks. The soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man as missing in that suicide.

Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with uniform nbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke from a orseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet; bleeding, emired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said, “Come and see how a arshal of France dies on the field of battle!” But in vain; he did not die. He as haggard and angry. At Drouet d’Erlon he hurled this question, “Are you not oing to get yourself killed?” In the midst of all that artillery engaged in rushing a handful of men, he shouted: “So there is nothing for me! Oh! I should ike to have all these English bullets enter my bowels!” Unhappy man, thou wert eserved for French bullets!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.13.2#The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,—Hougomont, La Haie-Sainte, apelotte, Plancenoit. The cry “Treachery!” was followed by a cry of “Save ourselves who can!” An army which is disbanding is like a thaw. All yields, plits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles, hastens, is precipitated. The isintegration is unprecedented. Ney borrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without at, cravat, or sword, places himself across the Brussels road, stopping both nglish and French. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, he nsults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly from him, houting, “Long live Marshal Ney!” Two of Durutte’s regiments go and come in ffright as though tossed back and forth between the swords of the Uhlans and he fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best, Pack, and Rylandt; the worst of and-to-hand conflicts is the defeat; friends kill each other in order to scape; squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other, like the remendous foam of battle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are rawn into the tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him f his Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable quadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur, Lobau efore Bülow, Morand before Pirch, Domon and Subervic before Prince William of russia; Guyot, who led the Emperor’s squadrons to the charge, falls beneath the eet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives, arangues, urges, threatens, entreats them. All the mouths which in the morning ad shouted, “Long live the Emperor!” remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. he Prussian cavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, slashes, ills, exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of the rtillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their escape; ransports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog the road and ccasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others walk over the dead nd the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills the roads, the paths, the ridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys, the woods, encumbered by this nvasion of forty thousand men. Shouts despair, knapsacks and guns flung among he rye, passages forced at the point of the sword, no more comrades, no more fficers, no more generals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to he sword at its leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.13.3#At Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a battle front, o draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entrance to the village as barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian canister, all took to flight gain, and Lobau was taken. That volley of grape-shot can be seen to-day mprinted on the ancient gable of a brick building on the right of the road at a ew minutes’ distance before you enter Genappe. The Prussians threw themselves nto Genappe, furious, no doubt, that they were not more entirely the onquerors. The pursuit was stupendous. Blücher ordered extermination. Roguet ad set the lugubrious example of threatening with death any French grenadier ho should bring him a Prussian prisoner. Blücher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the eneral of the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe, urrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword and slew the risoner. The victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished. Let s inflict punishment, since we are history: old Blücher disgraced himself. This erocity put the finishing touch to the disaster. The desperate route traversed enappe, traversed Quatre-Bras, traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, raversed Charleroi, traversed Thuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and ho, then, was fleeing in that manner? The Grand Army.

No. The shadow of an enormous ight is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of destiny. The force which s mightier than man produced that day. Hence the terrified wrinkle of those rows; hence all those great souls surrendering their swords. Those who had onquered Europe have fallen prone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to o, feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence. _Hoc erat in fatis_. That ay the perspective of the human race underwent a change. Waterloo is the hinge f the nineteenth century. The disappearance of the great man was necessary to he advent of the great century. Some one, a person to whom one replies not, ook the responsibility on himself. The panic of heroes can be explained. In the attle of Waterloo there is something more than a cloud, there is something of he meteor. God has passed by.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.14.1#Several squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the defeat, as ocks in running water, held their own until night. Night came, death also; they waited that double shadow, and, invincible, allowed themselves to be enveloped herein. Each regiment, isolated from the rest, and having no bond with the rmy, now shattered in every part, died alone. They had taken up position for his final action, some on the heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of ont-Saint-Jean. There, abandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy squares ndured their death-throes in formidable fashion. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, ied with them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.14.2#At twilight, towards nine o’clock in the evening, one of them was left at he foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley, at the foot of hat declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, now inundated by the masses f the English, under the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry, nder a frightful density of projectiles, this square fought on. It was ommanded by an obscure officer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square iminished and replied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, ontinually contracting its four walls. The fugitives pausing breathless for a oment in the distance, listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ver-decreasing thunder.

This furnished a sort of respite. These combatants had around hem something in the nature of a swarm of spectres, silhouettes of men on orseback, the black profiles of cannon, the white sky viewed through wheels and un-carriages, the colossal death’s-head, which the heroes saw constantly hrough the smoke, in the depths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at hem. Through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded; he matches all lighted, like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle round heir heads; all the lintstocks of the English batteries approached the cannons, nd then, with emotion, holding the supreme moment suspended above these men, an nglish general, Colville according to some, Maitland according to others, houted to them, “Surrender, brave Frenchmen!” Cambronne replied, “——.”

Some stammer, thers lisp. Jomini divides the battle of Waterloo into four moments; Muffling uts it up into three changes; Charras alone, though we hold another judgment han his on some points, seized with his haughty glance the characteristic utlines of that catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance. All he other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled, and in this dazzled tate they fumble about.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.17.2#If one places one’s self at the culminating point of view of the question, aterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It is Europe against rance; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against Paris; it is the _statu uo_ against the initiative; it is the 14th of July, 1789, attacked through the 0th of March, 1815; it is the monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to he indomitable French rioting. The final extinction of that vast people which ad been in eruption for twenty-six years—such was the dream. The solidarity of he Brunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs ith the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is true, that he Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural reaction of things, as forced to be liberal, and that a constitutional order was the unwilling esult of Waterloo, to the great regret of the conquerors. It is because evolution cannot be really conquered, and that being providential and bsolutely fatal, it is always cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte verthrowing the old thrones; after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and onforming to the charter. Bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of Naples, nd a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, employing inequality to demonstrate quality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights f man. If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is, call it Progress; and f you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress, call it To-morrow. o-morrow fulfils its work irresistibly, and it is already fulfilling it to-day. t always reaches its goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of Foy, who as only a soldier, an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the ribune. Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool for hat workman. It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine work he man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering invalid of ather Élysée. It makes use of the gouty man as well as of the conqueror; of the onqueror without, of the gouty man within. Waterloo, by cutting short the emolition of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause he revolutionary work to be continued in another direction. The slashers have inished; it was the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was ntended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished y liberty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.17.3#In short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; that which miled in Wellington’s rear; that which brought him all the marshals’ staffs of urope, including, it is said, the staff of a marshal of France; that which oyously trundled the barrows full of bones to erect the knoll of the lion; that hich triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date “_June_ 18, 1815”; that hich encouraged Blücher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, rom the heights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over ts prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution which urmured that infamous word “dismemberment.” On arriving in Paris, it beheld the rater close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorched its feet, and it hanged its mind; it returned to the stammer of a charter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.17.4#Let us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. Of intentional iberty there is none. The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal, in the ame manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon was involuntarily evolutionary. On the 18th of June, 1815, the mounted Robespierre was hurled rom his saddle.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.1#End of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.2#The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as it xpired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the barbarians; only the arbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet name of the ounter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to panting, and halted hort. The Empire was bewept,—let us acknowledge the fact,—and bewept by heroic yes. If glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre, the Empire had been lory in person. It had diffused over the earth all the light which tyranny can ive—a sombre light. We will say more; an obscure light. Compared to the true aylight, it is night. This disappearance of night produces the effect of an clipse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.3#Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of July ffaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the antithesis f the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was white. The exile eigned. Hartwell’s pine table took its place in front of the leur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy were mentioned as hough they had taken place on the preceding day, Austerlitz having become ntiquated. The altar and the throne fraternized majestically. One of the most ndisputed forms of the health of society in the nineteenth century was stablished over France, and over the continent. Europe adopted the white ockade. Trestaillon was celebrated. The device _non pluribus impar_ reappeared n the stone rays representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai ’Orsay. Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. The rc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, thrown out of its lement among these novelties, a little ashamed, it may be, of Marengo and rcola, extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the Duc ’Angoulême. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper’s grave in 1793, as covered with jasper and marble, since the bones of Louis XVI. and Marie ntoinette lay in that dust.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.4#In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth, ecalling the fact that the Duc d’Enghien had perished in the very month when apoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed the coronation very near his death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the fall as he had bestowed it n the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there was a little shadow, aged four, whom it as seditious to call the King of Rome. And these things took place, and the ings resumed their thrones, and the master of Europe was put in a cage, and the ld regime became the new regime, and all the shadows and all the light of the arth changed place, because, on the afternoon of a certain summer’s day, a hepherd said to a Prussian in the forest, “Go this way, and not that!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.5#This 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy and poisonous ealities were covered with new appearances. A lie wedded 1789; the right divine as masked under a charter; fictions became constitutional; prejudices, uperstitions and mental reservations, with Article 14 in the heart, were arnished over with liberalism. It was the serpent’s change of skin.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.6#Man had been rendered both greater and smaller by Napoleon. Under this eign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name of ideology! t is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future into derision. The opulace, however, that food for cannon which is so fond of the cannoneer, ought him with its glance. Where is he? What is he doing? “Napoleon is dead,” aid a passer-by to a veteran of Marengo and Waterloo. “He dead!” cried the oldier; “you don’t know him.” Imagination distrusted this man, even when verthrown. The depths of Europe were full of darkness after Waterloo. Something normous remained long empty through Napoleon’s disappearance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.7#The kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited by it to ndertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; _Belle-Alliance_, Beautiful lliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.8#In presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, the features f a new France were sketched out. The future, which the Emperor had rallied, ade its entry. On its brow it bore the star, Liberty. The glowing eyes of all oung generations were turned on it. Singular fact! people were, at one and the ame time, in love with the future, Liberty, and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had endered the vanquished greater. Bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than apoleon erect. Those who had triumphed were alarmed. England had him guarded by udson Lowe, and France had him watched by Montchenu. His folded arms became a ource of uneasiness to thrones. Alexander called him “my sleeplessness.” This error was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained in him. hat is what explains and excuses Bonapartist liberalism. This phantom caused he old world to tremble. The kings reigned, but ill at their ease, with the ock of Saint Helena on the horizon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.18.9#While Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, the ixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietly rotting, nd something of their peace was shed abroad over the world. The Congress of ienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called this the Restoration.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.1#Let us return—it is a necessity in this book—to that fatal attle-field.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.2#On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blücher’s erocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered up that isastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the massacre. Such ragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.3#After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean emained deserted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.4#The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign of ictory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established their bivouac eyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the retreating rout, pushed orward. Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to draw up his report to ord Bathurst.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.5#If ever the _sic vos non vobis_ was applicable, it certainly is to that illage of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, and lay half a league from the scene f action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont was burned, La Haie-Sainte as taken by assault, Papelotte was burned, Plancenoit was burned, La elle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the two conquerors; these names are hardly nown, and Waterloo, which worked not in the battle, bears off all the onor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.6#We are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasion resents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beauties which we ave not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideous features. One of he most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the ictory. The dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.7#Who does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand is hat which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets are they who ly their trade in the rear of glory? Some philosophers—Voltaire among the umber—affirm that it is precisely those persons who have made the glory. It is he same men, they say; there is no relief corps; those who are erect pillage hose who are prone on the earth. The hero of the day is the vampire of the ight. One has assuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when one s the author of that corpse. For our own part, we do not think so; it seems to s impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the shoes from dead man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.8#One thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors follow hieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary soldier, out f the question.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.9#Every army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed. Bat-like reatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of vespertillos that that wilight called war engenders; wearers of uniforms, who take no part in the ighting; pretended invalids; formidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting long in little carts, sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things hich they sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; oldiers’ servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,—we are not peaking of the present,—dragged all this behind them, so that in the special anguage they are called “stragglers.” No army, no nation, was responsible for hose beings; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans, then spoke French and ollowed the English. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who poke French, that the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, and aking him for one of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on the attle-field itself, in the course of the night which followed the victory of erisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. The detestable maxim, _Live on he enemy!_ produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline alone could heal. here are reputations which are deceptive; one does not always know why certain enerals, great in other directions, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by is soldiers because he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part of oodness. Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered ver to fire and blood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less n number, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and Marceau had o stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice to mention it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.10#Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the dead ere robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught in the act hould be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole in one corner of he battlefield while others were being shot in another.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.11#The moon was sinister over this plain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.1.19.12#Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in the irection of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one of those hom we have just described,—neither English nor French, neither peasant nor oldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies aving theft for his victory, and come to rifle Waterloo. He was clad in a louse that was something like a great coat; he was uneasy and audacious; he alked forwards and gazed behind him. Who was this man? The night probably knew ore of him than the day. He had no sack, but evidently he had large pockets nder his coat. From time to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as hough to see whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something ilent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding motion, his ttitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him to resemble those wilight larvæ which haunt ruins, and which ancient Norman legends call the lleurs.

The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and iders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There was no longer any lope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain, and reached the rim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A heap of dead bodies in the upper art, a river of blood in the lower part—such was that road on the evening of he 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there verflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, t a spot which is still pointed out.

It appears hat previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M. affitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, and which he ad, moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in his business. No ne has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed this money since is return to prison at Toulon.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.1.7#A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just ppeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances calculated o attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the olice, he had changed his name, and had succeeded in getting himself appointed ayor of one of our small northern towns; in this town he had established a onsiderable commerce. He has at last been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the ndefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of he town, who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who s endowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three or four ays after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more, in Paris tself, at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles hich run between the capital and the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He s said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty, to ithdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. his sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the ndictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself lone, and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be, the aid Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the Department of he Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight ears ago, on the person of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch f Ferney has said, in immortal verse,

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.1.9#This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and loquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was committed n complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member of a band of obbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to he death penalty in consequence. This criminal refused to lodge an appeal. The ing, in his inexhaustible clemency, has deigned to commute his penalty to that f penal servitude for life. Jean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at oulon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.1.10#The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at M. ur M. Some papers, among others the _Constitutional_, presented this ommutation as a triumph of the priestly party.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.1.12#However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be bliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished with M. adeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was ealized; lacking him, there actually was _a soul lacking_. After this fall, here took place at M. sur M. that egotistical division of great existences hich have fallen, that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is ccomplished every day, obscurely, in the human community, and which history has oted only once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants re crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. nvious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine’s vast workshops were shut; his buildings ell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted the country, thers abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, nstead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of the general good. There was no onger a centre; everywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine ad reigned over all and directed all. No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled hings to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization, itterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence of the ounder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were tangled and roken, the methods were adulterated, the products were debased, confidence was illed; the market diminished, for lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the orkshops stood still, bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for he poor. All had vanished.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.1#Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some etail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch, in ontfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of he indictment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.2#There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, hich is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a popular uperstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. We are among hose who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant. Here, then, s the superstition of Montfermeil: it is thought that the devil, from time mmemorial, has selected the forest as a hiding-place for his treasures. oodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded ooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, earing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable y the fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his ead. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is habitually ngaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting by such an ncounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to him. Then it is seen hat the man is simply a peasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall; hat he is not digging any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and hat what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is arrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, eemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the week. he second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has illed it and has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to open t once more and to seize the “treasure” which the black man has necessarily laced there. In this case one dies within the month. Finally, the last method s not to speak to the black man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best peed of one’s legs. One then dies within the year.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.3#As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the econd, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others that of ossessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generally adopted. o bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are ssured, opened the holes excavated by the black man, and tried to rob the evil. The success of the operation appears to be but moderate. At least, if the radition is to be believed, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in arbarous Latin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon as left on this subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges e Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.4#Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily xtremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night—for it must be done at ight; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock, and when he rrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on the “treasure,” what oes he find? What is the devil’s treasure? A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a tone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes a spectre folded in four like a heet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon’s verses eem to announce to the indiscreet and curious:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.5#“Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca, As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, imulacra, nihilque.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.6#It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with ullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has evidently erved the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived n the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit o invent powder before Roger Bacon’s time, and cards before the time of Charles I.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.7#Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that one ossesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property of aking your gun burst in your face.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.8#Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting ttorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight of several ays had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in that village that certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had “peculiar ways” in the orest. People thereabouts thought they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in he galleys. He was subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could ind work nowhere, the administration employed him at reduced rates as a oad-mender on the crossroad from Gagny to Lagny.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.9#This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants f the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt in removing his cap to very one, and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes,—probably ffiliated to robber bands, they said; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of opses at nightfall. The only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.10#This is what people thought they had noticed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.11#Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking and are of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to the forest ith his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted learings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the appearance of being in search f something, and sometimes he was digging holes. The goodwives who passed took im at first for Beelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in he least reassured thereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a ively displeasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was ome mystery in what he was doing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.12#It was said in the village: “It is clear that the devil has appeared. oulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunning enough o pocket Lucifer’s hoard.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.14#In the meantime, Boulatruelle’s manœuvres in the forest ceased; and he esumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped of something lse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.15#Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this here was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some fine windfall f a more serious and palpable sort than the devil’s bank-bills, and that the oad-mender had half discovered the secret. The most “puzzled” were the choolmaster and Thénardier, the proprietor of the tavern, who was everybody’s riend, and had not disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.16#“He has been in the galleys,” said Thénardier. “Eh! Good God! no one knows ho has been there or will be there.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.17#One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would ave instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest, and that he latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would have been put to he torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle would not have resisted the ater test, for example. “Let us put him to the wine test,” said Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.18#They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking. Boulatruelle rank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combined with admirable art, nd in masterly proportions, the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of judge. Nevertheless, by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and utting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is hat Thénardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.19#One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, he ad been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, a shovel nd a pickaxe, _concealed, as one might say_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.2.20#However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and ick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no more bout it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being seen himself, s he was hidden by a large tree, “a person who did not belong in those parts, nd whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,” directing his steps towards the densest art of the wood. Translation by Thénardier: _A comrade of the galleys_. oulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name. This person carried a ackage—something square, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the art of Boulatruelle. However, it was only after the expiration of seven or ight minutes that the idea of following that “person” had occurred to him. But t was too late; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, and oulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him. Then he had adopted the ourse of watching for him at the edge of the woods. “It was moonlight.” Two or hree hours later, Boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood, arrying no longer the coffer, but a shovel and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed he person to pass, and had not dreamed of accosting him, because he said to imself that the other man was three times as strong as he was, and armed with a ickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him, nd on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion of two old comrades n meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to oulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had found either shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that this person, nce in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and eclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a ody; therefore it contained money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had xplored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had dug herever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up. In vain.

A rand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of France succoring and rotecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say, performing an act devolving on he elder; an apparent return to our national traditions, complicated by ervitude and by subjection to the cabinets of the North; M. le Duc d’Angoulême, urnamed by the liberal sheets _the hero of Andujar_, compressing in a triumphal ttitude that was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and ery powerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical errorism of the liberals; the _sansculottes_ resuscitated, to the great terror f dowagers, under the name of _descamisados_; monarchy opposing an obstacle to rogress described as anarchy; the theories of ’89 roughly interrupted in the ap; a European halt, called to the French idea, which was making the tour of he world; beside the son of France as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, fterwards Charles Albert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against eople as a volunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of he Empire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight ears of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standard waved broad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard had been thirty ears earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our troops; the spirit of liberty nd of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets; principles slaughtered by annonades; France undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind; in ddition to this, hostile leaders sold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged by illions; no military perils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine hich is surprised and invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shame or some, glory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended rom Louis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon. Its sad ate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics.

It seemed vident that certain Spanish officers charged with resistance yielded too asily; the idea of corruption was connected with the victory; it appears as hough generals and not battles had been won, and the conquering soldier eturned humiliated.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.3.7#From a still more serious point of view, and one which it is also proper to nsist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spirit of France, enraged he democratic spirit. It was an enterprise of enthralment. In that campaign, he object of the French soldier, the son of democracy, was the conquest of a oke for others. A hideous contradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of ations, not to stifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the rench Revolution: liberty darts rays from France. That is a solar fact.

There are moments when a bit f rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, and it is a terrible hing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall like a ripe ruit.

On arriving on a level with the top, a gust of wind arried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen: he was not young man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.2.3.26#A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, in act, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch, and, in he midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew, while all the ailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked the officer’s permission o risk his life to save the topman; at an affirmative sign from the officer he ad broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had aught up a rope, and had dashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the nstant, with what ease that chain had been broken; it was only later on that he incident was recalled.

At last, the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a tep: the crowd drew a long breath. He was seen to run out along the yard: on rriving at the point, he fastened the rope which he had brought to it, and llowed the other end to hang down, then he began to descend the rope, hand over and, and then,—and the anguish was indescribable,—instead of one man suspended ver the gulf, there were two.

It was high time; one minute more, and the exhausted nd despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss. The onvict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clung with one hand, hile he was working with the other. At last, he was seen to climb back on the ard, and to drag the sailor up after him; he held him there a moment to allow im to recover his strength, then he grasped him in his arms and carried him, alking on the yard himself to the cap, and from there to the main-top, where he eft him in the hands of his comrades.

In order to reach them the more speedily, he dropped into the igging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes were following him. At a ertain moment fear assailed them; whether it was that he was fatigued, or that is head turned, they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger. All at once the rowd uttered a loud shout: the convict had fallen into the sea.

The frigate _Algésiras_ was anchored alongside the Orion_, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: it was to be eared that he would slip under one or the other of them. Four men flung hemselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them on; anxiety again took ossession of all souls; the man had not risen to the surface; he had isappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple, as though he had fallen into a ask of oil: they sounded, they dived. In vain. The search was continued until he evening: they did not even find the body.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.head#CHAPTER I—THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.1#Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge of hat lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At the present ay it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year through with plaster illas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In 1823 there were at Montfermeil either so many white houses nor so many well-satisfied citizens: it was only a illage in the forest. Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met ith there, to be sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their alconies in twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all orts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but ontfermeil was nonetheless a village. Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating ttorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, hich was not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, that easant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, water was rare here, on account of the elevation of the plateau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.2#It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of the illage towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in he woods there. The other end, which surrounds the church and which lies in the irection of Chelles, found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down he slope, near the road to Chelles, about a quarter of an hour from ontfermeil.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.3#Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. The arge houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thénardier tavern formed a part, aid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it, and who arned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying Montfermeil with ater; but this good man only worked until seven o’clock in the evening in ummer, and five in winter; and night once come and the shutters on the ground loor once closed, he who had no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or id without it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.4#This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has robably not forgotten,—little Cosette. It will be remembered that Cosette was seful to the Thénardiers in two ways: they made the mother pay them, and they ade the child serve them. So when the mother ceased to pay altogether, the eason for which we have read in preceding chapters, the Thénardiers kept osette. She took the place of a servant in their house. In this capacity she it as who ran to fetch water when it was required. So the child, who was greatly errified at the idea of going to the spring at night, took great care that ater should never be lacking in the house.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.5#Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. The eginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow nor frost up o that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permission of the mayor o erect their booths in the principal street of the village, and a band of tinerant merchants, under protection of the same tolerance, had constructed heir stalls on the Church Square, and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, here, as the reader will perhaps remember, the Thénardiers’ hostelry was ituated. These people filled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to hat tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part f a faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities isplayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad n rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil n 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did ot possess until 1845, and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I elieve that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the rder of the Apicides, and to the family of the vultures. Some good old onapartist soldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see this creature ith great devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a nique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.6#On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, were eated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in the public oom of Thénardier’s hostelry. This room resembled all drinking-shop ooms,—tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; but little light and a reat deal of noise. The date of the year 1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by wo objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class: to wit, a aleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin. The female Thénardier was attending to he supper, which was roasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was rinking with his customers and talking politics.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.7#Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects the panish war and M. le Duc d’Angoulême, strictly local parentheses, like the ollowing, were audible amid the uproar:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.8#“About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When ten ieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a great deal f juice under the press.” “But the grapes cannot be ripe?” “In those parts the rapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as soon as spring comes.” “Then t is very thin wine?” “There are wines poorer even than these. The grapes must e gathered while green.” Etc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.9#Or a miller would call out:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.10#“Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a quantity f small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are obliged to send through he mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a ost of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which abound in certain wheat, specially in Breton wheat. I am not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more han long-sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them. You can judge of the bad ust that makes in grinding. And then people complain of the flour. They are in he wrong. The flour is no fault of ours.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.11#In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with a anded proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be performed n the spring, was saying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.12#“It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a good hing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young and very ard to cut still. It’s terribly tender. It yields before the iron.” Etc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.13#Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen able near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into wooden hoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings estined for the young Thénardiers. A very young kitten was playing about among he chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in the adjoining room, from two resh children’s voices: it was Éponine and Azelma.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.1.15#At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the ouse, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy who had been orn to the Thénardiers during one of the preceding winters,—“she did not know hy,” she said, “the result of the cold,”—and who was a little more than three ears old. The mother had nursed him, but she did not love him. When the ersistent clamor of the brat became too annoying, “Your son is squalling,” hénardier would say; “do go and see what he wants.” “Bah!” the mother would eply, “he bothers me.” And the neglected child continued to shriek in the ark.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.1#So far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile; the oment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and considering it nder all its aspects.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.2#Thénardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thénardier was pproaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so that there xisted a balance of age between husband and wife.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.3#Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thénardier oman, ever since her first appearance,—tall, blond, red, fat, angular, square, normous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those olossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging rom their hair. She did everything about the house,—made the beds, did the ashing, the cooking, and everything else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse n the service of an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her oice,—window panes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red lotches, presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an deal market-porter dressed in woman’s clothes. She swore splendidly; she oasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except for the omances which she had read, and which made the affected lady peep through the gress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would never have occurred to any ne to say of her, “That is a woman.” This Thénardier female was like the roduct of a wench engrafted on a fishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, That is a gendarme”; when one saw her drink, one said, “That is a carter”; when ne saw her handle Cosette, one said, “That is the hangman.” One of her teeth rojected when her face was in repose.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.4#Thénardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had a ickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here; he smiled abitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to he beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He had the glance of a pole-cat nd the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly resembled the portraits of the bbé Delille. His coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters. No one had ver succeeded in rendering him drunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, nd under his blouse an old black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to aterialism. There were certain names which he often pronounced to support hatever things he might be saying,—Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly nough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had “a system.” In addition, he was great swindler. A _filousophe_ [philosophe], a scientific thief. The species oes exist. It will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army; e was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the th or the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the resence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved rom death, in the midst of the grape-shot, “a general, who had been dangerously ounded.” Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn the name hich it bore in the neighborhood, of “the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.” e was a liberal, a classic, and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ ’Asile. It was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.5#We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. This ascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming from Lille, in landers, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, being comfortably astride f both frontiers. As for his prowess at Waterloo, the reader is already cquainted with that. It will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb nd flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered onscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of une 18, 1815, Thénardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which e have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some, stealing from thers, and travelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety art, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching imself to the victorious army. This campaign ended, and having, as he said, some quibus,” he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.6#This _quibus_, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silver rosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did not amount o a large total, and did not carry this sutler turned eating-house-keeper very ar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.7#Thénardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures hich, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign of the cross, he seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be thought that he was an ducated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced mproperly.12
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.8#He composed the travellers’ tariff card in a superior manner, but practised yes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it. Thénardier was cunning, reedy, slothful, and clever. He did not disdain his servants, which caused his ife to dispense with them. This giantess was jealous. It seemed to her that hat thin and yellow little man must be an object coveted by all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.9#Thénardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was a camp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters into t.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.10#It is not that Thénardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to quite he same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such times, since he as enraged with the human race in general, as he bore within him a deep furnace f hatred. And since he was one of those people who are continually avenging heir wrongs, who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which as befallen them, and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who omes to hand, as a legitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the ankruptcies, and the calamities of their lives,—when all this leaven was tirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. Woe o the person who came under his wrath at such a time!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.11#In addition to his other qualities, Thénardier was attentive and enetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and always highly ntelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who are accustomed to crew up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses. Thénardier was a tatesman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.12#Every newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame hénardier, “There is the master of the house.” A mistake. She was not even the istress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked; he created. He irected everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action. A word as sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed. Thénardier was a ort of special and sovereign being in Madame Thénardier’s eyes, though she did ot thoroughly realize it. She was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if he had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with “Monsieur hénardier,”—which was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,—she would not ave blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever. She would never have ommitted “before strangers” that mistake so often committed by women, and which s called in parliamentary language, “exposing the crown.” Although their oncord had only evil as its result, there was contemplation in Madame hénardier’s submission to her husband. That mountain of noise and of flesh oved under the little finger of that frail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and rotesque side, this was that grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind y matter; for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal eauty. There was an unknown quantity about Thénardier; hence the absolute mpire of the man over that woman. At certain moments she beheld him like a ighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.13#This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children, nd who did not fear any one except her husband. She was a mother because she as mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short with her daughters, and, as we hall see, did not extend to boys. The man had but one thought,—how to enrich imself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.14#He did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent was acking. Thénardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin is possible to ero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a illionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse where fate has hitched him.

He ad a certain cold and tranquil laugh, which was particularly dangerous.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.2.18#His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes. He ad professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife’s mind. “The duty of he inn-keeper,” he said to her one day, violently, and in a low voice, “is to ell to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire, dirty sheets, a servant, ice, and a smile; to stop passers-by, to empty small purses, and to honestly ighten heavy ones; to shelter travelling families respectfully: to shave the an, to pluck the woman, to pick the child clean; to quote the window open, the indow shut, the chimney-corner, the armchair, the chair, the ottoman, the tool, the feather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much he shadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five hundred housand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even for the flies hich his dog eats!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.3.2#Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years old, he had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of n old woman.

Thirsty people were never lacking there; but their thirst was f the sort which applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher. Any one who had sked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a avage to all these men. But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame hénardier raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then eized a glass and briskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the hild had raised her head and was following all the woman’s movements. A thin tream of water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass. “Well,” aid she, “there is no more water!” A momentary silence ensued. The child did ot breathe.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.4.1#The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the reader ill remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thénardiers. These booths were all lluminated, because the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight ass, with candles burning in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then eated at the table at the Thénardiers’ observed, produced “a magical effect.” n compensation, not a star was visible in the sky.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.4.2#The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the Thénardiers’ oor, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass, and magnificent objects f tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the merchant had placed on a ackground of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two feet high, who was ressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold wheat-ears on her head, which had eal hair and enamel eyes. All that day, this marvel had been displayed to the onderment of all passers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being ound in Montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to er child. Éponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and Cosette erself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.4.3#At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and overcome s she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll, owards _the lady_, as she called it. The poor child paused in amazement. She ad not yet beheld that doll close to. The whole shop seemed a palace to her: he doll was not a doll; it was a vision. It was joy, splendor, riches, appiness, which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little eing so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and nnocent sagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her rom that doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at least a rincess, to have a “thing” like that. She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, hat beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, “How happy that doll must be!” She ould not take her eyes from that fantastic stall. The more she looked, the more azzled she grew. She thought she was gazing at paradise. There were other dolls ehind the large one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii. The merchant, ho was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the ffect of being the Eternal Father.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.4.4#In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she was harged.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.4.7#Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of which he was capable.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.1#As the Thénardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is near he church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of Chelles that osette was obliged to go for her water.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.2#She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long as he was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the lighted talls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the last stall anished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She plunged into it. Only, s a certain emotion overcame her, she made as much motion as possible with the andle of the bucket as she walked along. This made a noise which afforded her ompany.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.3#The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one in he streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around on seeing er, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: “Where can that child be oing? Is it a werewolf child?” Then the woman recognized Cosette. “Well,” said he, “it’s the Lark!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.4#In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted treets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of Chelles. So ong as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path, she roceeded with tolerable boldness. From time to time she caught the flicker of a andle through the crack of a shutter—this was light and life; there were people here, and it reassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace lackened mechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last ouse, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the last stall; t became impossible to proceed further than the last house. She set her bucket n the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and began slowly to scratch her ead,—a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do. It as no longer Montfermeil; it was the open fields. Black and desert space was efore her. She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any ne, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a ood look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw pectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear had lent er audacity. “Bah!” said she; “I will tell him that there was no more water!” nd she resolutely re-entered Montfermeil.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.5#Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch er head again. Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her, with her hideous, yena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast a melancholy glance efore her and behind her. What was she to do? What was to become of her? Where as she to go? In front of her was the spectre of the Thénardier; behind her all he phantoms of the night and of the forest. It was before the Thénardier that he recoiled. She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged rom the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or istening to anything. She only paused in her course when her breath failed her; ut she did not halt in her advance. She went straight before her in esperation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.6#As she ran she felt like crying.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.7#The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.8#She no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night was facing his tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other, an atom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.9#It was only seven or eight minutes’ walk from the edge of the woods to the pring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many times in aylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of instinct guided her aguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to right or to left, for fear of eeing things in the branches and in the brushwood. In this manner she reached he spring.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.10#It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayey oil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall, crimped rasses which are called Henry IV.‘s frills, and paved with several large tones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil little noise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.11#Cosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in the abit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the dark for a oung oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually served to support her, ound one of its branches, clung to it, bent down, and plunged the bucket in the ater. She was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was rebled. While thus bent over, she did not notice that the pocket of her apron ad emptied itself into the spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. osette neither saw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and et it on the grass.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.12#That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She would ave liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill the bucket ad been such that she found it impossible to take a step. She was forced to sit own. She dropped on the grass, and remained crouching there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.13#She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, but ecause she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucket beside her as describing circles which resembled tin serpents.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.14#Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like asses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over the hild.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.16#The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which she as unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact, very near the orizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted to it a horrible uddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled, magnified the star. One would have alled it a luminous wound.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.17#A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leaf as moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide. Great oughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and misshapen bushes histled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated like eels under the north ind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished with claws in search of rey. Some bits of dry heather, tossed by the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had he air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after. On all ides there were lugubrious stretches.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.18#The darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries himself n the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye sees black, the eart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the sooty opacity, there is nxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one walks alone in the forest at ight without trembling. Shadows and trees—two formidable densities. A himerical reality appears in the indistinct depths. The inconceivable is utlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness. One beholds loating, either in space or in one’s own brain, one knows not what vague and ntangible thing, like the dreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce ttitudes on the horizon. One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One s afraid to glance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities of night, hings grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances, obscure ishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubrious reflected in the unereal, the sepulchral immensity of silence, unknown but possible beings, endings of mysterious branches, alarming torsos of trees, long handfuls of uivering plants,—against all this one has no protection. There is no hardihood hich does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish. One is onscious of something hideous, as though one’s soul were becoming amalgamated ith the darkness. This penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in he case of a child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.19#Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul roduces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.20#Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she was eized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terror alone hich was gaining possession of her; it was something more terrible even than error; she shivered. There are no words to express the strangeness of that hiver which chilled her to the very bottom of her heart; her eye grew wild; she hought she felt that she should not be able to refrain from returning there at he same hour on the morrow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.21#Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three, our, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular state which she id not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she had finished, she egan again; this restored her to a true perception of the things about her. Her ands, which she had wet in drawing the water, felt cold; she rose; her terror, natural and unconquerable terror, had returned: she had but one thought ow,—to flee at full speed through the forest, across the fields to the houses, o the windows, to the lighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which tood before her; such was the fright which the Thénardier inspired in her, that he dared not flee without that bucket of water: she seized the handle with both ands; she could hardly lift the pail.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.22#In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it was eavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took breath for an nstant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and resumed her march, roceeding a little further this time, but again she was obliged to pause. After ome seconds of repose she set out again. She walked bent forward, with drooping ead, like an old woman; the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her hin arms. The iron handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and iny hands; she was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she did o, the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs. This took lace in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far from all human sight; he was a child of eight: no one but God saw that sad thing at the moment.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.26#However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went on ery slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and of walking as ong as possible between them, she reflected with anguish that it would take her ore than an hour to return to Montfermeil in this manner, and that the hénardier would beat her. This anguish was mingled with her terror at being lone in the woods at night; she was worn out with fatigue, and had not yet merged from the forest. On arriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she as acquainted, made a last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might et well rested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucket gain, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little desperate reature could not refrain from crying, “O my God! my God!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.5.27#At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer eighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just seized he handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A large black form, traight and erect, was walking beside her through the darkness; it was a man ho had come up behind her, and whose approach she had not heard.

This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, and he seemed o halt, by preference, at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of he faubourg Saint-Marceau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.2#We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in that solated quarter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.3#This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of what ay be called the well-bred mendicant,—extreme wretchedness combined with xtreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent earts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor, nd for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very old and very well brushed ound hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color hat was not in the least eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with ockets of a venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of lack worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been ronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration. He ould have been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectly white air, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance, where everything reathed depression and weariness of life. Judging from his firm tread, from the ingular vigor which stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been hought fifty. The wrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have isposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively. His lip contracted ith a strange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble. There was in the epth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his left hand he arried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a ort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, nd had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its nots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it was a udgel, and it seemed to be a cane.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.4#There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in the winter. he man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but this without any ffectation.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.6#This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter ho said, “It is two o’clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.7#And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king lways creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of Louis VIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was rapid but ajestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop; as he was not able o walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by he lightning. He passed, pacific and severe, in the midst of naked swords. His assive couch, all covered with gilding, with great branches of lilies painted n the panels, thundered noisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance pon it. In the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of hite satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered _à l’oiseau oyal_, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great paulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, he cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of he Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside f Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees nwrapped in high English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his at and saluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in ind. When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter, the hole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of he faubourg to his comrade, “That big fellow yonder is the government.”

But the man lunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg, and as twilight was eginning to fall, the agent lost trace of him, as is stated in a report ddressed that same evening to M. le Comte d’Anglès, Minister of State, Prefect f Police.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.26#An instant later he had disappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.27#He did not enter the inn.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.28#When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not encounter im in the principal street of Chelles.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.29#The coachman turned to the inside travellers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.30#“There,” said he, “is a man who does not belong here, for I do not know im. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider money; he pays o Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is night; all the houses are hut; he does not enter the inn, and he is not to be found. So he has dived hrough the earth.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.31#The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great strides hrough the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he had turned to he right before reaching the church, into the crossroad leading to Montfermeil, ike a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.32#He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by the ncient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard people oming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there waited until he passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was nearly superfluous, owever; for, as we have already said, it was a very dark December night. Not ore than two or three stars were visible in the sky.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.33#It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did not eturn to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to the right, and ntered the forest with long strides.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.34#Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful examination f all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seeking and following a ysterious road known to himself alone. There came a moment when he appeared to ose himself, and he paused in indecision. At last he arrived, by dint of eeling his way inch by inch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of hitish stones. He stepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them ttentively through the mists of night, as though he were passing them in eview. A large tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts of egetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones. He went up to his tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, as though seeking to ecognize and count all the warts.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.35#Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree, suffering rom a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of ressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.36#Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between he tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to assure himself hat the soil has not recently been disturbed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.37#That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the orest.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.38#It was the man who had just met Cosette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.6.39#As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he had spied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden on the ground, hen taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, and perceived that it was very young child, laden with an enormous bucket of water. Then he approached he child, and silently grasped the handle of the bucket.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.7.17#“I don’t know,” answered the child.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.7.26#The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her once ore; then he removed his hands from Cosette’s shoulders, seized the bucket, and et out again.

From time to time she raised her eyes towards he man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.7.41#Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.1#Cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll, hich was still displayed at the toy-merchant’s; then she knocked. The door pened. The Thénardier appeared with a candle in her hand.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.4#The Thénardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace, a hange of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought the newcomer with er eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.5#“This is the gentleman?” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.6#“Yes, Madame,” replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.7#Wealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspection of he stranger’s costume and baggage, which the Thénardier passed in review with ne glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the gruff mien to eappear. She resumed dryly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.8#“Enter, my good man.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.9#The “good man” entered. The Thénardier cast a second glance at him, paid articular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare, and to is hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing her head, wrinkling her nose, nd screwing up her eyes, she consulted her husband, who was still drinking with he carters. The husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the orefinger, which, backed up by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such ases: A regular beggar. Thereupon, the Thénardier exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.10#“Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.11#“Put me where you like,” said the man; “in the attic, in the stable. I ill pay as though I occupied a room.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.17#“That’s true,” added her husband, gently; “it ruins a house to have such eople in it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.18#In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench, had eated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine nd a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his orse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table, and her nitting.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.19#The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured ut for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.20#Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We ave already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was thin and ale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to be hardly six. Her large yes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put out with weeping. The corners f her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned ersons and desperately sick people. Her hands were, as her mother had divined, ruined with chilblains.” The fire which illuminated her at that moment brought nto relief all the angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully pparent. As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing er knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a rag which would ave inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter. All she had n was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen. Her skin was visible here and here and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried, which marked the laces where the Thénardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and ed. The hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep. This child’s whole erson, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she llowed to elapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her lightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole idea,—fear.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.21#Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak; fear rew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her petticoat, made er occupy as little space as possible, allowed her only the breath that was bsolutely necessary, and had become what might be called the habit of her body, dmitting of no possible variation except an increase. In the depths of her eyes here was an astonished nook where terror lurked.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.22#Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did not are to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her work gain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.23#The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually o gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain moments as though he were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.24#As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had never et foot in a church. “Have I the time?” said the Thénardier.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.28#Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thénardier uplifted her oice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.29#She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the expedient f children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.36#Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green. he fifteen-sou piece was not there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.37#“Ah, come now,” said Madame Thénardier, “did you hear me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.38#Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What could ave become of that money? The unhappy little creature could not find a word to ay. She was petrified.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.45#Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle of he chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude limbs. The hénardier raised her arm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.46#“Pardon me, Madame,” said the man, “but just now I caught sight of omething which had fallen from this little one’s apron pocket, and rolled side. Perhaps this is it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.47#At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for moment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.48#“Exactly; here it is,” he went on, straightening himself up.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.51#It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thénardier found it o her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined herself to asting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the remark, “Don’t let his ever happen again!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.52#Cosette returned to what the Thénardier called “her kennel,” and her large yes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an expression such s they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an innocent amazement, but a ort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.53#“By the way, would you like some supper?” the Thénardier inquired of the raveller.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.54#He made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.55#“What sort of a man is that?” she muttered between her teeth. “He’s some rightfully poor wretch. He hasn’t a sou to pay for a supper. Will he even pay e for his lodging? It’s very lucky, all the same, that it did not occur to him o steal the money that was on the floor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.56#In the meantime, a door had opened, and Éponine and Azelma entered.

They were warmly clad, but with so much aternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry f arrangement. There was a hint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly ffaced. Light emanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on he throne. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they made, here was sovereignty.

While dreaming and chattering, making tiny outfits, nd baby clothes, while sewing little gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child rows into a young girl, the young girl into a big girl, the big girl into a oman.

She had not a moment to lose; she crept out from under the table on her ands and knees, made sure once more that no one was watching her; then she lipped quickly up to the doll and seized it. An instant later she was in her lace again, seated motionless, and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the oll which she held in her arms.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.184#“Why! it is perfectly simple,” replied Thénardier, “if that amuses him! t amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her play. He’s ll right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it. If the old ellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If he is an imbecile, it does ot concern you. What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.185#The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither of hich admitted of any reply.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.186#The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtful ttitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had withdrawn a ittle, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him from a distance, with a ort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed man, who drew “hind-wheels” from his ocket with so much ease, and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats n wooden shoes, was certainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.187#Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased, the rinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed, the public oom was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still remained in the same lace and the same attitude. From time to time he changed the elbow on which he eaned. That was all; but he had not said a word since Cosette had left the oom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.188#The Thénardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained in he room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.189#“Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?” grumbled the Thénardier. hen two o’clock in the morning struck, she declared herself vanquished, and aid to her husband, “I’m going to bed. Do as you like.” Her husband seated imself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle, and began to read the Courrier Français_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.190#A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the _Courrier rançais_ at least three times, from the date of the number to the printer’s ame. The stranger did not stir.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.191#Thénardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked his chair. ot a movement on the man’s part. “Is he asleep?” thought Thénardier. The man as not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.192#At last Thénardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, and entured to say:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.193#“Is not Monsieur going to his repose?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.194#_Not going to bed_ would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. _To epose_ smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the mysterious and dmirable property of swelling the bill on the following day. A chamber where ne _sleeps_ costs twenty sous; a chamber in which one _reposes_ costs twenty rancs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.195#“Well!” said the stranger, “you are right. Where is your stable?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.196#“Sir!” exclaimed Thénardier, with a smile, “I will conduct you, sir.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.197#He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and hénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of rare plendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtained with red alico.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.198#“What is this?” said the traveller.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.199#“It is really our bridal chamber,” said the tavern-keeper. “My wife and I ccupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.200#“I should have liked the stable quite as well,” said the man, bruptly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.201#Thénardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.202#He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the himney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.203#On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman’s head-dress in ilver wire and orange flowers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.204#“And what is this?” resumed the stranger.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.205#“That, sir,” said Thénardier, “is my wife’s wedding bonnet.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.206#The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say, There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.207#Thénardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building for the urpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber decorated in ust this manner, and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange lowers at second hand, with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse,” and would result in what the English call respectability for his ouse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.208#When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thénardier had ithdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night, as he did not ish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece oyally the following morning.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.209#The inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was not sleep. When she heard her husband’s step she turned over and said to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.210#“Do you know, I’m going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.211#Thénardier replied coldly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.212#“How you do go on!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.213#They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle was xtinguished.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.214#As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a orner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an armchair and remained or some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes, took one of the two andles, blew out the other, opened the door, and quitted the room, gazing about im like a person who is in search of something. He traversed a corridor and ame upon a staircase. There he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the reathing of a child. He followed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular ecess built under the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This ecess was nothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the midst of ll sorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders’ webs, was a ed—if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to isplay the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet. No sheets. his was placed on the floor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.215#In this bed Cosette was sleeping.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.216#The man approached and gazed down upon her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.217#Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter she id not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.218#Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open, littered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though he were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almost convulsively n her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.219#A door which stood open near Cosette’s pallet permitted a view of a ather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further extremity, hrough a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds. They belonged to ponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden, stood an uncurtained icker cradle, in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay sleep.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.220#The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the hénardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the ireplace—one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire hen there is any fire at all, and which are so cold to look at. There was no ire in this one, there was not even ashes; but there was something which ttracted the stranger’s gaze, nevertheless. It was two tiny children’s shoes, oquettish in shape and unequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and mmemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the himney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift rom their good fairy. Éponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this, and ach of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.221#The traveller bent over them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.222#The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, and n each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.223#The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing, hen far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight of another bject. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a frightful shoe of the oarsest description, half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud. t was Cosette’s sabot. Cosette, with that touching trust of childhood, which an always be deceived yet never discouraged, had placed her shoe on the earth-stone also.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.224#Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and ouching thing.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.8.227#Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.1#On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break, Thénardier, eated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen in hand, was making ut the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.2#His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following him ith her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there was profound editation, on the other, the religious admiration with which one watches the irth and development of a marvel of the human mind. A noise was audible in the ouse; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.3#After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures, Thénardier roduced the following masterpiece:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.4#BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.6#Service was written _servisse_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.7#“Twenty-three francs!” cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was ingled with some hesitation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.8#Like all great artists, Thénardier was dissatisfied.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.9#“Peuh!” he exclaimed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.10#It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France’s bill at the Congress of ienna.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.11#“Monsieur Thénardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,” murmured the ife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the presence of her aughters. “It is just, but it is too much. He will not pay it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.12#Thénardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.13#“He will pay.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.14#This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That hich was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did not insist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.15#She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment ater he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.16#“I owe full fifteen hundred francs!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.17#He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his eet among the warm ashes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.18#“Ah! by the way,” resumed his wife, “you don’t forget that I’m going to urn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart with that oll of hers! I’d rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another day in the ouse!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.19#Thénardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.20#“You will hand that bill to the man.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.21#Then he went out.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.22#Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.23#Thénardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the alf-open door, visible only to his wife.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.24#The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.25#“Up so early?” said Madame Thénardier; “is Monsieur leaving us lready?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.26#As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an mbarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard face resented a shade which was not habitual with it,—timidity and scruples.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.27#To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air “of a poor retch” seemed difficult to her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.28#The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He eplied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.29#“Yes, Madame, I am going.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.30#“So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.31#“No, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, Madame,” he dded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.32#The Thénardier silently handed him the folded bill.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.33#The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were vidently elsewhere.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.34#“Madame,” he resumed, “is business good here in Montfermeil?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.35#“So so, Monsieur,” replied the Thénardier, stupefied at not witnessing nother sort of explosion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.36#She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.37#“Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in he neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now and then, ome rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should not get along at all. e have so many expenses. Just see, that child is costing us our very eyes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.38#“What child?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.39#“Why, the little one, you know! Cosette—the Lark, as she is called ereabouts!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.40#“Ah!” said the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.41#She went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.42#“How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more the air f a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and we cannot estow it. We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal. The license, the mposts, the door and window tax, the hundredths! Monsieur is aware that the overnment demands a terrible deal of money. And then, I have my daughters. I ave no need to bring up other people’s children.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.43#The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent, and n which there lingered a tremor:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.44#“What if one were to rid you of her?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.45#“Who? Cosette?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.48#“Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her away, ugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the blessings of the ood holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.54#“Cosette!” screamed the Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.55#“In the meantime,” pursued the man, “I will pay you what I owe you. How uch is it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.56#He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of urprise:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.57#“Twenty-three francs!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.58#He looked at the landlady, and repeated:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.59#“Twenty-three francs?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.60#There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent etween an exclamation and an interrogation point.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.61#The Thénardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She replied, ith assurance:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.62#“Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.63#The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.64#“Go and get the child,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.65#At that moment Thénardier advanced to the middle of the room, and aid:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.66#“Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.67#“Twenty-six sous!” exclaimed his wife.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.68#“Twenty sous for the chamber,” resumed Thénardier, coldly, “and six sous or his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a little with the entleman. Leave us, wife.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.69#Madame Thénardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected ightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor was making his ntrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and left the room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.70#As soon as they were alone, Thénardier offered the traveller a chair. The raveller seated himself; Thénardier remained standing, and his face assumed a ingular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.71#“Sir,” said he, “what I have to say to you is this, that I adore that hild.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.72#The stranger gazed intently at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.73#“What child?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.74#Thénardier continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.75#“How strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? Take back your undred-sou piece. I adore the child.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.76#“Whom do you mean?” demanded the stranger.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.77#“Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from us? ell, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will not consent to t. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was a tiny thing. It is rue that she costs us money; it is true that she has her faults; it is true hat we are not rich; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs or drugs for just one of her illnesses! But one must do something for the good od’s sake. She has neither father nor mother. I have brought her up. I have read enough for her and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that hild. You understand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good sort f a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my wife is uick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just the same as our own hild. I want to keep her to babble about the house.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.78#The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thénardier. The latter ontinued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.79#“Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one’s child to a passer-by, ike that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don’t say—you are rich; you have the ir of a very good man,—if it were for her happiness. But one must find out hat. You understand: suppose that I were to let her go and to sacrifice myself, should like to know what becomes of her; I should not wish to lose sight of er; I should like to know with whom she is living, so that I could go to see er from time to time; so that she may know that her good foster-father is live, that he is watching over her. In short, there are things which are not ossible. I do not even know your name. If you were to take her away, I should ay: ‘Well, and the Lark, what has become of her?’ One must, at least, see some etty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.80#The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as the aying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a grave, firm oice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.81#“Monsieur Thénardier, one does not require a passport to travel five eagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, and that is he end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not know my esidence, you will not know where she is; and my intention is that she shall ever set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I break the thread which binds er foot, and she departs. Does that suit you? Yes or no?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.82#Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God by ertain signs, Thénardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong erson. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with his clear and agacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters, smoking, and singing oarse songs on the preceding evening, he had devoted the whole of the time to bserving the stranger, watching him like a cat, and studying him like a athematician. He had watched him, both on his own account, for the pleasure of he thing, and through instinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been aid for so doing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the ellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so clearly anifested his interest in Cosette, Thénardier had divined his purpose. He had aught the old man’s deep glances returning constantly to the child. Who was his man? Why this interest? Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money n his purse? Questions which he put to himself without being able to solve hem, and which irritated him. He had pondered it all night long. He could not e Cosette’s father. Was he her grandfather? Then why not make himself known at nce? When one has a right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no right over osette. What was it, then? Thénardier lost himself in conjectures. He caught limpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may, on entering into onversation with the man, sure that there was some secret in the case, that the atter had some interest in remaining in the shadow, he felt himself strong; hen he perceived from the stranger’s clear and firm retort, that this ysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that e was weak. He had expected nothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to he rout. He rallied his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. hénardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He decided hat the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quickly at that. e did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which they know that they lone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.84#The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather, pened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the table. Then he placed is large thumb on the notes and said to the inn-keeper:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.85#“Go and fetch Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.86#While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.87#On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found the old piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new wenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little Prussian ueue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Her destiny began to ntoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece was; she had never seen one; he hid it quickly in her pocket, as though she had stolen it. Still, she felt hat it really was hers; she guessed whence her gift had come, but the joy which he experienced was full of fear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied. uch magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real. The doll frightened er, the gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence of this agnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary, he eassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her amazement, even in er sleep, she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who eemed to be so poor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind. Everything had hanged for her since she had met that good man in the forest. Cosette, less appy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, had never known what it was o take refuge under a mother’s shadow and under a wing. For the last five ears, that is to say, as far back as her memory ran, the poor child had hivered and trembled. She had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp ind of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed. Formerly her soul had eemed cold, now it was warm. Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thénardier. he was no longer alone; there was some one there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.88#She hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which she ad about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece had fallen n the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touch it, but she pent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue hanging out, if the truth ust be told. As she swept the staircase, she paused, remained standing there otionless, forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe, occupied in azing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.9.89#It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thénardier oined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband’s orders. What was uite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to er.

Some eighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again; the Lark and he man had been seen going in the direction of Livry.

It is the ate of many men to live thus half submerged. In a calm and even situation, hénardier possessed all that is required to make—we will not say to be—what eople have agreed to call an honest trader, a good bourgeois. At the same time ertain circumstances being given, certain shocks arriving to bring his nder-nature to the surface, he had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have ccasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Thénardier welt, and have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous asterpiece.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.10.26#He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thénardier’s eyes the while, and nunciating every syllable distinctly:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.10.28#“Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact, I ave not the right to give her to you.

You will say to me, ‘But her other is dead.’ Good; in that case I can only give the child up to the person ho shall bring me a writing, signed by her mother, to the effect that I am to and the child over to the person therein mentioned; that is clear.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.10.29#The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and Thénardier eheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.10.32#Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him: the pot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the woods or in the alley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and drew from it, not the andful of bills which Thénardier expected, but a simple little paper, which he nfolded and presented fully open to the inn-keeper, saying:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.10.45#“It is well, sir,” he said, “since you are the person, but I must be paid or all those little things. A great deal is owing to me.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.3.10.47#“Monsieur Thénardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owed ou one hundred and twenty francs. In February, you sent her a bill of five undred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end of February, and hree hundred francs at the beginning of March. Since then nine months have lapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the price agreed upon, which makes one undred and thirty-five francs. You had received one hundred francs too much; hat makes thirty-five still owing you. I have just given you fifteen hundred rancs.”

The man turned round from time to time, and ooked to see if he was being followed. All at once he caught sight of hénardier.

The man cast upon him an uneasy glance, then levated his head and continued his course. The inn-keeper set out again in ursuit. Thus they continued for two or three hundred paces. All at once the man urned round once more; he saw the inn-keeper.

He swam under water until he reached a vessel at nchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding himself in this oat until night. At night he swam off again, and reached the shore a little way rom Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack money, he procured clothing. A small ountry-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the ressing-room of escaped convicts,—a lucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, ike all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law nd social fatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his irst refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards rand-Villard, near Briançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy light,—a mole’s track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace f his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the yrenees, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of havailles, and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La hapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.

It was o longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it was not the country, for there ere houses and streets; it was not the city, for the streets had ruts like ighways, and the grass grew in them; it was not a village, the houses were too ofty. What was it, then? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it as a desert place where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great ity, a street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day han a cemetery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.2#It was the old quarter of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.

There, near a factory, and between two garden alls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the first lance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large s a cathedral. It presented its side and gable to the public road; hence its pparent diminutiveness. Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door nd one window could be seen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.4#This hovel was only one story high.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.5#The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could never ave been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if it had been arved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry, might have been he lattice of a lordly mansion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.6#The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly bound ogether by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It opened directly on steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky, plaster-stained, dusty steps, f the same width as itself, which could be seen from the street, running traight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls. he top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow cantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed, which served oth as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On the inside of the door he figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in nk, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number 50, so that one esitated. Where was one? Above the door it said, “Number 50”; the inside eplied, “no, Number 52.” No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended ike draperies from the triangular opening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.7#The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetian linds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes were uffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and betrayed by an ngenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and unpasted, threatened assers-by rather than screened the occupants. The horizontal slats were missing ere and there and had been naïvely replaced with boards nailed on erpendicularly; so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter. This door ith an unclean, and this window with an honest though dilapidated air, thus eheld on the same house, produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking ide by side, with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always een a mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.8#The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had een converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinal tube, a long orridor, on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied imensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances, and rather more ike stalls than cells.

The two names had been forestalled by a Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers; they made the most of t. A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the ourt-house, in verses that limped a little:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.15#Maître Corbeau, sur un dossier perché, Tenait dans son bec une saisie xécutoire; Maître Renard, par l’odeur alléché, Lui fit à peu près cette istoire: Hé! bonjour. Etc.13

The ing, who was laughing, continued to laugh, passed gayly from the two bishops to he two lawyers, and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names, or early so. By the kings command, Maître Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to is initial letter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maître Renard was less lucky; ll he obtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and to call himself renard; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the irst.

An odor of copperas issued in uffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.

It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration, prisoners ondemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their execution. It was there, hat, about 1829, was committed that mysterious assassination, called “The ssassination of the Fontainebleau barrier,” whose authors justice was never ble to discover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a rightful enigma which has never been unriddled. Take a few steps, and you come pon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to he sound of thunder, as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at he abominable pollarded elms of the Barrière Saint-Jacques, that expedient of he philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and shameful Place de rève of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before the death enalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it with uthority.

In addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one here, one was conscious of being between the Salpêtrière, a glimpse of whose ome could be seen, and Bicêtre, whose outskirts one was fairly touching; that s to say, between the madness of women and the madness of men. As far as the ye could see, one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and he fronts of a few factories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere bout stood hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white alls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings erected n a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the melancholy sadness of ight angles. Not an unevenness of the ground, not a caprice in the rchitecture, not a fold. The _ensemble_ was glacial, regular, hideous. Nothing ppresses the heart like symmetry. It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is t the very foundation of grief. Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a ell where one suffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. f such a hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l’Hôpital might have formed he entrance to it.

The black lines sink inwards nd are lost in the shades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot efrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are onnected with the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have een committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a presentiment f meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness eemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse etween each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; y night it was sinister.

Even at that time any one who was esirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole ffect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans ailway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it, as it does to-day. herever it is placed on the borders of a capital, a railway station is the eath of a suburb and the birth of a city. It seems as though, around these reat centres of the movements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled nd yawned, to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to pring forth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these onstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old ouses crumble and new ones rise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.1.28#Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière, the ncient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the Jardin des lantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by hose currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back he houses to the right and the left; for there are things which are odd when aid that are rigorously exact; and just as it is true to say that in large ities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is ertain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of new life are evident. In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks, he pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer, even here there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,—a memorable morning in July, 845,—black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day it might be aid that civilization had arrived in the Rue de l’Ourcine, and that Paris had ntered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.

The chamber which he entered, and which he closed again nstantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic, furnished with a mattress aid on the floor, a table, and several chairs; a stove in which a fire was urning, and whose embers were visible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the oulevard cast a vague light into this poor room.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.3.3#Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had been lone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. In the rison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy. The heart of that x-convict was full of virginity. His sister and his sister’s children had left im only a vague and far-off memory which had finally almost completely anished; he had made every effort to find them, and not having been able to ind them, he had forgotten them. Human nature is made thus; the other tender motions of his youth, if he had ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.

She was so little when her mother left her, that she no onger remembered her. Like all children, who resemble young shoots of the vine, hich cling to everything, she had tried to love; she had not succeeded. All had epulsed her,—the Thénardiers, their children, other children. She had loved the og, and he had died, after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do ith her. It is a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at ight years of age, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the aculty of loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from the ery first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man.

Destiny suddenly united and edded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences, differing in ge, alike in sorrow. One, in fact, completed the other. Cosette’s instinct ought a father, as Jean Valjean’s instinct sought a child. To meet was to find ach other. At the mysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded ogether.

He liked to go to Saint-Médard, which is the nearest church. When he id not take Cosette with him, she remained with the old woman; but the child’s elight was to go out with the good man.

This had its disadvantages. e began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of _the beggar who gives lms_.

She was a little deaf, which rendered her talkative. There emained to her from her past, two teeth,—one above, the other below,—which she as continually knocking against each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had ot been able to tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself except that he had come from Montfermeil. One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, with an ir which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of the uninhabited ompartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step of an old cat, and was ble to observe him without being seen, through a crack in the door, which was irectly opposite him. Jean Valjean had his back turned towards this door, by ay of greater security, no doubt. The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket nd draw thence a case, scissors, and thread; then he began to rip the lining of ne of the skirts of his coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish aper, which he unfolded.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.1#Near Saint-Médard’s church there was a poor man who was in the habit of rouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and on whom ean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed this man without iving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him. Those who envied this endicant said that he belonged to the police. He was an ex-beadle of eventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his prayers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.2#One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette with im, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern which had just een lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, according to his custom, and was uch bent over. Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in is hand. The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean aljean, then dropped his head quickly. This movement was like a flash of ightning. Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder. It seemed to him that he had ust caught sight, by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and eaming visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling face. He xperienced the same impression that one would have on finding one’s self, all f a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He recoiled, terrified, etrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak, to remain, nor to flee, staring t the beggar who had dropped his head, which was enveloped in a rag, and no onger appeared to know that he was there. At this strange moment, an nstinct—possibly the mysterious instinct of self-preservation,—restrained Jean aljean from uttering a word. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the ame appearance as he had every day. “Bah!” said Jean Valjean, “I am mad! I am reaming! Impossible!” And he returned profoundly troubled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.3#He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he thought e had seen was the face of Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.4#That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not having questioned he man, in order to force him to raise his head a second time.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.5#On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at his ost. “Good day, my good man,” said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handing him a sou. he beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice, “Thanks, my good ir.” It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.6#Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. “How the deuce ould I have thought that I saw Javert there?” he thought. “Am I going to lose y eyesight now?” And he thought no more about it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.7#A few days afterwards,—it might have been at eight o’clock in the vening,—he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud, when he eard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him as singular. The ld woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself, always went o bed at nightfall, so that she might not burn out her candles. Jean Valjean ade a sign to Cosette to be quiet. He heard some one ascending the stairs. It ight possibly be the old woman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to he apothecary’s. Jean Valjean listened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.8#The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman wore tout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man s that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.9#He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, “Get into bed ery softly”; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.10#Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the door, eated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding his breath in the ark.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.11#After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he eard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber, e saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort of sinister star in he blackness of the door and the wall. There was evidently some one there, who as holding a candle in his hand and listening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.12#Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard no ound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had been istening at the door had removed his shoes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.13#Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and could ot close his eyes all night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.14#At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was wakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the orridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the tairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching. He sprang off the bed nd applied his eye to the keyhole, which was tolerably large, hoping to see the erson who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his oor, as he passed. It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without ausing, in front of Jean Valjean’s chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow f the person’s face being distinguished; but when the man reached the taircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette, and ean Valjean had a complete view of his back. The man was of lofty stature, clad n a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable neck and houlders belonged to Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.15#Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through is window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been obliged to open the indow: he dared not.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.16#It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself. Who ad given him that key? What was the meaning of this?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.4.5.17#When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o’clock in the morning, ean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not question her. The ood woman appeared as usual.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.1#An observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which the eader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with further on.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.2#The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself, as been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been transformed since he uitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion, unknown to him. here is no need for him to say that he loves Paris: Paris is his mind’s natal ity. In consequence of demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, hat Paris which he bore away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days one by. He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. t is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says, “In uch a street there stands such and such a house,” neither street nor house will ny longer exist in that locality. Readers may verify the facts if they care to ake the trouble. For his own part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and e writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to im. It is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him omething of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, and that all as not vanished. So long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine hat those streets are a matter of indifference to you; that those windows, hose roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that those walls are strangers o you; that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard; that those ouses, which you do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you read are merely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive hat the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors; and hat those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well beloved by you; that ou entered those houses which you never entered, every day, and that you have eft a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements. All hose places which you no longer behold, which you may never behold again, erchance, and whose memory you have cherished, take on a melancholy charm, ecur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land isible to you, and are, so to speak, the very form of France, and you love hem; and you call them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, nd you will submit to no change: for you are attached to the figure of your atherland as to the face of your mother.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.3#May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? That said, e beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.4#Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets, aking the most intricate lines which he could devise, returning on his track at imes, to make sure that he was not being followed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.5#This manœuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where an imprint of he track may be left, this manœuvre possesses, among other advantages, that of eceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwing them on the wrong scent. In enery this is called _false re-imbushment_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.6#The moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. The oon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and shadow in he streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark ide, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did not, perhaps, take ufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him. Still, n the deserted lanes which lie near the Rue Poliveau, he thought he felt ertain that no one was following him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.7#Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of the first ix years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature. oreover,—and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to ecur,—she had grown used, without being herself aware of it, to the eculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny. And then she was ith him, and she felt safe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.8#Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. He trusted n God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also were clinging to the and of some one greater than himself; he thought he felt a being leading him, hough invisible. However, he had no settled idea, no plan, no project. He was ot even absolutely sure that it was Javert, and then it might have been Javert, ithout Javert knowing that he was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not e believed to be dead? Still, queer things had been going on for several days. e wanted no more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house. ike the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in which he ight hide until he could find one where he might dwell.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.9#Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard uarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the Middle Ages nd the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in various manners, with unning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue Copeau, the Rue du attoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l’Ermite. There are lodging houses in his locality, but he did not even enter one, finding nothing which suited him. e had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track, they would ave lost it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.10#As eleven o’clock struck from Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, he was traversing the ue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of police, situated at o. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which we have spoken above made him urn round. At that moment he saw distinctly, thanks to the commissary’s antern, which betrayed them, three men who were following him closely, pass, ne after the other, under that lantern, on the dark side of the street. One of he three entered the alley leading to the commissary’s house. The one who arched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.11#“Come, child,” he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the Rue ontoise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.12#He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which was losed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l‘Épée-de-Bois and the ue de l’Arbalète, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.13#At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets, here the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève urns off.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.14#It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is an old treet, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des Postes once n ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes was inhabited by otters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.15#The moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went into mbush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still following him, he ould not fail to get a good look at them, as they traversed this illuminated pace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.16#In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their ppearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in long, brown oats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Their great stature and heir vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride hrough the darkness. One would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as ourgeois.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.1.17#They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men in onsultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to be their eader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction hich Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate the contrary direction ith considerable obstinacy. At the moment when the first man wheeled round, the oon fell full in his face. Jean Valjean recognized Javert perfectly.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.2.1#Uncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lasted for he men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost for them, but ained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself, nd went down the Rue des Postes, towards the region of the Jardin des Plantes. osette was beginning to be tired. He took her in his arms and carried her. here were no passers-by, and the street lanterns had not been lighted on ccount of there being a moon.

In order to reach them, it was necessary to risk imself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space. He did not esitate.

The street was straight in his rear. he first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing; the silence as profound, and he continued his march somewhat reassured. All at once, on urning round, he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had ust passed through, far off in the obscurity, something which was moving.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.8#He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find some ide-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scent once ore.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.17#The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between the aubourg Saint-Antoine and la Râpée, is one of those which recent improvements ave transformed from top to bottom,—resulting in disfigurement according to ome, and in a transfiguration according to others. The market-gardens, the imber-yards, and the old buildings have been effaced. To-day, there are rand-new, wide streets, arenas, circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a rison, Mazas, there; progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.18#Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all ompounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut _les uatre-Nations_, and the Opera-Comique _Feydeau_, the precise spot whither Jean aljean had arrived was called _le Petit-Picpus_. The Porte Saint-Jacques, the orte Paris, the Barrière des Sergents, the Porcherons, la Galiote, les élestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe, l’Arbre de Cracovie, la etite-Pologne—these are the names of old Paris which survive amid the new. The emory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.19#Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, and never as more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish aspect of a panish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets were not much built up. ith the exception of the two or three streets, of which we shall presently peak, all was wall and solitude there. Not a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a andle lighted here and there in the windows; all lights extinguished after ten ’clock. Gardens, convents, timber-yards, marshes; occasional lowly dwellings nd great walls as high as the houses.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.20#Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed it oundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it. Rubbish shoots ere established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter was disappearing under he erasing process of new buildings. To-day, it has been utterly blotted out. he Petit-Picpus, of which no existing plan has preserved a trace, is indicated ith sufficient clearness in the plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis hierry, Rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Plâtre; and at Lyons, by Jean irin, Rue Mercière, at the sign of Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, as we have just entioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which pread out in two branches, taking on the left the name of Little Picpus Street, nd on the right the name of the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were onnected at the apex as by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue olonceau ended there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the enoir market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue olonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at a right ngle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right a truncated rolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and was called the ul-de-Sac Genrot.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.22#As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette standing n guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue Petit-Picpus, he ecoiled. There could be no doubt of it. That phantom was lying in wait for im.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.23#What was he to do?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.3.24#The time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived in ovement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and his squad ithout a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencement of the street t whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all appearances, was acquainted with his little labyrinth, and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men o guard the exit. These surmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled uddenly, like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, hrough Jean Valjean’s mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there e was cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel. He saw hat black form standing out in relief against the white pavement, illuminated y the moon; to advance was to fall into this man’s hands; to retreat was to ling himself into Javert’s arms. Jean Valjean felt himself caught, as in a net, hich was slowly contracting; he gazed heavenward in despair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.head#CHAPTER IV—THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.1#In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact idea f the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one leaves on the eft when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this lane. Droit-Mur lane was lmost entirely bordered on the right, as far as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses f mean aspect; on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines, composed f numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they pproached the Rue Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very ofty on the Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the ue Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to such degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abut directly on he street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners rom two observers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in he Rue Droit-Mur.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.2#Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the Rue olonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the Rue roit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomy building hich we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected, thus forming another etreating angle in the street. This gable was sombre of aspect; only one window as visible, or, to speak more correctly, two shutters covered with a sheet of inc and kept constantly closed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.3#The state of the places of which we are here giving a description is igorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of ld inhabitants of the quarter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.4#The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and retched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular planks, the pper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by long transverse trips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary imensions, and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years reviously.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.5#A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was covered ith ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.6#In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre uilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him. He ran is eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he could contrive to get nside it, he might save himself. First he conceived an idea, then a hope.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.7#In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue Droit-Mur ide, there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern ipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe o all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front. These amifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless ine-stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm-houses.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.8#This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first thing hat struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against a stone post, ith an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where the conduit touched he pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the ouse. But the pipe was dilapidated and past service, and hardly hung to its astenings. Moreover, all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with eavy iron bars, even the attic windows in the roof. And then, the moon fell ull upon that façade, and the man who was watching at the corner of the street ould have seen Jean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be one with Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story ouse?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.9#He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled long the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.10#When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he oticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he was oncealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were approaching; esides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were two doors; perhaps they ight be forced. The wall above which he saw the linden-tree and the ivy vidently abutted on a garden where he could, at least, hide himself, although here were as yet no leaves on the trees, and spend the remainder of the ight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.11#Time was passing; he must act quickly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.12#He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact that t was impracticable outside and in.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.13#He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully decrepit; ts very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were rotten; the iron ands—there were only three of them—were rusted. It seemed as though it might be ossible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.4.14#On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither inges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands traversed it rom side to side without any break. Through the crevices in the planks he aught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together, hich passers-by might still have seen there ten years ago. He was forced to cknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden ecoration of a building against which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a lank; but then, one found one’s self face to face with a wall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.head#CHAPTER V—WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.1#At that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some istance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street. Seven or ight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched into the Rue olonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were advancing towards him; hese soldiers, at whose head he distinguished Javert’s tall figure, advanced lowly and cautiously. They halted frequently; it was plain that they were earching all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and lleys.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.2#This was some patrol that Javert had encountered—there could be no mistake s to this surmise—and whose aid he had demanded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.3#Javert’s two acolytes were marching in their ranks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.4#At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of the halts hich they were making, it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach he spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful moment. A few minutes only eparated Jean Valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for he third time. And the galleys now meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost o him forever; that is to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.5#There was but one thing which was possible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.6#Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say, two eggar’s pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other the edoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the other, according o circumstances.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.7#Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison t Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in the incredible art f crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheer muscular force, by eaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his hips, and his knees, by elping himself on the rare projections of the stone, in the right angle of a all, as high as the sixth story, if need be; an art which has rendered so elebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris y which Battemolle, condemned to death, made his escape twenty years ago.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.8#Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the inden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formed with the able of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity, by a mass of asonry of a triangular shape, probably intended to preserve that too convenient orner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers-by. This ractice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in Paris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.9#This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit of this ass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.10#The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.11#Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall. hould he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It was mpossible to carry her. A man’s whole strength is required to successfully arry out these singular ascents. The least burden would disturb his centre of ravity and pull him downwards.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.12#A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he to et a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjean had had kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that moment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.13#All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes azzle, sometimes illuminate us.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.14#Jean Valjean’s despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of the lind alley Genrot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.15#At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At nightfall anterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended and escended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side to side, and as adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley over which this rope ran was astened underneath the lantern in a little iron box, the key to which was kept y the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protected by a metal case.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.16#Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the street at ne bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little box with the oint of his knife, and an instant later he was beside Cosette once more. He had rope. These gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting gainst fatality.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.17#We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that ight. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct, like the est; and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no onger in its place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.18#Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean’s bsorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all had begun to ender Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have given vent to loud hrieks long before. She contented herself with plucking Jean Valjean by the kirt of his coat. They could hear the sound of the patrol’s approach ever more nd more distinctly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.19#“Father,” said she, in a very low voice, “I am afraid. Who is coming onder?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.20#“Hush!” replied the unhappy man; “it is Madame Thénardier.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.21#Cosette shuddered. He added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.22#“Say nothing. Don’t interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, the hénardier is lying in wait for you. She is coming to take you back.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.23#Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firm and urt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and Javert might ome upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed it round Cosette’s body nder the armpits, taking care that it should not hurt the child, fastened this ravat to one end of the rope, by means of that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot,” took the other end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his hoes and stockings, which he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of asonry, and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with s much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his eet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees n the wall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.24#Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. Jean aljean’s injunction, and the name of Madame Thénardier, had chilled her lood.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.31#Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands in is large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of he wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood a building whose oof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very hort distance of the ground, with a gentle slope which grazed the linden-tree. lucky circumstance, for the wall was much higher on this side than on the treet side. Jean Valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below im.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.32#He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the crest f the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol. The hundering voice of Javert was audible:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.33#“Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the Rue etit-Picpus. I’ll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.5.35#Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fast to osette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whether from terror r courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though her hands were a little braded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.head#CHAPTER VI—THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.1#Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of ingular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at n winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape, with an alley of large oplars at the further end, tolerably tall forest trees in the corners, and an nshaded space in the centre, where could be seen a very large, solitary tree, hen several fruit-trees, gnarled and bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, melon patch, whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. ere and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were ordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had half taken ossession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.2#Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a eans of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly against the all, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a hapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.3#The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers were istinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a shed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.4#The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue etit-Picpus, turned two façades, at right angles, towards this garden. These nterior façades were even more tragic than the exterior. All the windows were rated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them. The upper story had cuttles like prisons. One of those façades cast its shadow on the other, which ell over the garden like an immense black pall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.5#No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist and arkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which intersected as hough there were more cultivated land beyond, and the low roofs of the Rue olonceau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.6#Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined. There as no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; but it did not eem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in, even in broad aylight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.7#Jean Valjean’s first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on gain, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is fleeing never hinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose thoughts were still on the hénardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as ossible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.8#Cosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous noise f the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the blows of their un-stocks against the stones; Javert’s appeals to the police spies whom he had osted, and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be istinguished.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.9#At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species f stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held his breath.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.11#However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that this rightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb him by so much as he shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those walls had been built of the eaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.12#All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a ound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been orrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst of prayer nd harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night; women’s voices, ut voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and he innocent accents of children,—voices which are not of the earth, and which esemble those that the newborn infant still hears, and which the dying man ears already. This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above he garden. At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have aid that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.6.18#All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street; there as nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had reassured im,—all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the all, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy sound.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.7.17#Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed that e was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light. He stood on iptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all opened on a tolerably ast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up by arcades and pillars, where nly a tiny light and great shadows were visible. The light came from a taper hich was burning in one corner. The apartment was deserted, and nothing was tirring in it. Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived n the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, and hich resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flat on the avement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the immobility of eath. One would have said, judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over he floor, that this sinister form had a rope round its neck.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.7.18#The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely lluminated, which adds to horror.

He began to run towards the hed, not daring to look behind him. It seemed to him, that if he turned his ead, he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its rms.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.1#The child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.2#He sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazed at er, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.3#He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth, hat so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he should need othing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her. He was not even onscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off his coat to cover er.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.4#Nevertheless, athwart this reverie into which he had fallen he had heard or some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. This sound roceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly though faintly. It esembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the astures.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.5#This noise made Valjean turn round.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.6#He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.7#A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon eds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he were ragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person appeared to imp.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.8#Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For them verything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day because it enables eople to see them, and the night because it aids in surprising them. A little hile before he had shivered because the garden was deserted, and now he hivered because there was some one there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.9#He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to himself hat Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; that they ad, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if this man should iscover him in the garden, he would cry out for help against thieves and eliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her ehind a heap of old furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner f the shed. Cosette did not stir.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.10#From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon atch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell followed each f this man’s movements. When the man approached, the sound approached; when the an retreated, the sound retreated; if he made any hasty gesture, a tremolo ccompanied the gesture; when he halted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident hat the bell was attached to that man; but what could that signify? Who was his man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.11#As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette’s hands. They ere icy cold.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.12#“Ah! good God!” he cried.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.13#He spoke to her in a low voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.14#“Cosette!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.15#She did not open her eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.16#He shook her vigorously.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.17#She did not wake.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.18#“Is she dead?” he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering from ead to foot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.19#The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There are oments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, and violently orce the partitions of our brains. When those we love are in question, our rudence invents every sort of madness. He remembered that sleep in the open air n a cold night may be fatal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.20#Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet, ithout a movement.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.21#He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respiration hich seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.22#How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that was ot connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildly from the uin.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.8.23#It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside a ire in less than a quarter of an hour.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.head#CHAPTER IX—THE MAN WITH THE BELL
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.1#He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had taken in is hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.2#The man’s head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In a few trides Jean Valjean stood beside him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.3#Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.4#“One hundred francs!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.5#The man gave a start and raised his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.6#“You can earn a hundred francs,” went on Jean Valjean, “if you will grant e shelter for this night.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.7#The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean’s terrified countenance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.8#“What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!” said the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.9#That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot, by hat strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.10#He had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him was a ent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on his left knee leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell. His face, which was in he shadow, was not distinguishable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.11#However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all ver:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.12#“Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter? ieu-Jésus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about that: if ever ou do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in! You have no ravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you know, you would have rightened any one who did not know you? No coat! Lord God! Are the saints going ad nowadays? But how did you get in here?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.13#His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rustic olubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered with a ixture of stupefaction and _naïve_ kindliness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.14#“Who are you? and what house is this?” demanded Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.15#“Ah! pardieu, this is too much!” exclaimed the old man. “I am the person or whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you had me laced. What! You don’t recognize me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.16#“No,” said Jean Valjean; “and how happens it that you know me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.17#“You saved my life,” said the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.18#He turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean ecognized old Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.19#“Ah!” said Jean Valjean, “so it is you? Yes, I recollect you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.20#“That is very lucky,” said the old man, in a reproachful tone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.21#“And what are you doing here?” resumed Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.22#“Why, I am covering my melons, of course!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.23#In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent eld in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over he melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he ad already spread out a number of them. It was this operation which had caused im to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by Jean aljean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.24#He continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.25#“I said to myself, ‘The moon is bright: it is going to freeze. What if I ere to put my melons into their greatcoats?’ And,” he added, looking at Jean aljean with a broad smile,—“pardieu! you ought to have done the same! But how o you come here?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.26#Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under the ame of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multiplied his uestions. Strange to say, their rôles seemed to be reversed. It was he, the ntruder, who interrogated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.27#“And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.28#“This,” replied Fauchelevent, “is so that I may be avoided.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.29#“What! so that you may be avoided?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.30#Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.31#“Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house—many young girls. It ppears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell gives them arning. When I come, they go.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.32#“What house is this?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.33#“Come, you know well enough.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.37#“Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.38#Memories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence, had ast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine where old auchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had been admitted on his ecommendation two years previously. He repeated, as though talking to imself:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.39#“The Petit-Picpus convent.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.40#“Exactly,” returned old Fauchelevent. “But to come to the point, how the euce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter if you are saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.41#“You certainly are here.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.44#“Ah, good God!” cried Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.45#Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a grave oice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.46#“Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.47#“I was the first to recall it,” returned Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.48#“Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden ays.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.49#Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands Jean aljean’s two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as though incapable of peaking. At length he exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.50#“Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you some ittle return for that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, dispose of the old an!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.51#A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance seemed to mit a ray of light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.52#“What do you wish me to do?” he resumed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.53#“That I will explain to you. You have a chamber?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.54#“I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent, in corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms in it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.55#The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverly rranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceived it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.56#“Good,” said Jean Valjean. “Now I am going to ask two things of you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.57#“What are they, Mr. Mayor?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.58#“In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about me. n the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.59#“As you please. I know that you can do nothing that is not honest, that ou have always been a man after the good God’s heart. And then, moreover, you t was who placed me here. That concerns you. I am at your service.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.60#“That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the hild.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.61#“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “so there is a child?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.62#He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog follows is master.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.9.63#Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy again before he flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener’s bed. Jean aljean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat, which he had flung ver the wall, had been found and picked up. While Jean Valjean was putting on is coat, Fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap, which now hung on a ail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall. The two men were warming hemselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had laced a bit of cheese, black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the ld man was saying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter’s knee: Ah! Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you save people’s ives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they remember you! You are an ngrate!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.1#The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak, had ome about in the simplest possible manner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.2#When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrested im beside Fantine’s death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. sur M., the olice had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris. Paris is a maelstrom here everything is lost, and everything disappears in this belly of the world, s in the belly of the sea. No forest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives f every sort know this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which ave. The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have ost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to aris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful ssistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean. Javert’s zeal and intelligence on hat occasion had been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture nder Comte Anglès. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert’s atron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. here Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem trange for such services, honorable manners.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.3#He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,—the wolf of to-day causes these dogs ho are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,—when, in December, 823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers; but Javert, a onarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of he “Prince Generalissimo” into Bayonne. Just as he was finishing the article, hich interested him; a name, the name of Jean Valjean, attracted his attention t the bottom of a page. The paper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was ead, and published the fact in such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. e confined himself to the remark, “That’s a good entry.” Then he threw aside he paper, and thought no more about it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.4#Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted from he prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in Paris, oncerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under peculiar ircumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil. A little girl of even or eight years of age, the report said, who had been intrusted by her other to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; his child answered to the name of Cosette, and was the daughter of a girl named antine, who had died in the hospital, it was not known where or when.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.5#This report came under Javert’s eye and set him to thinking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.6#The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean Valjean ad made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a respite of three ays, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature’s child. He recalled the act that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris at the very moment when he was tepping into the coach for Montfermeil. Some signs had made him suspect at the ime that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach, and that he ad already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood of that illage, for he had not been seen in the village itself. What had he been ntending to do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not even be surmised. avert understood it now. Fantine’s daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going here in search of her. And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! Who ould that stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead. avert, without saying anything to anybody, took the coach from the _Pewter latter_, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.7#He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he found a reat deal of obscurity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.8#For the first few days the Thénardiers had chattered in their rage. The isappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He immediately btained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the abduction of a hild. Hence the police report. But their first vexation having passed off, hénardier, with his wonderful instinct, had very quickly comprehended that it s never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the Crown, and that his omplaints with regard to the _abduction_ of Cosette would have as their first esult to fix upon himself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the littering eye of justice. The last thing that owls desire is to have a candle rought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred francs hich he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag on his wife’s mouth, nd feigned astonishment when the _stolen child_ was mentioned to him. He nderstood nothing about it; no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that ear little creature “taken from him” so hastily; he should have liked to keep er two or three days longer, out of tenderness; but her “grandfather” had come or her in the most natural way in the world. He added the “grandfather,” which roduced a good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived t Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.9#Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into hénardier’s history. “Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?” hénardier replied with simplicity: “He is a wealthy farmer. I saw his passport. think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.10#Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javert eturned to Paris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.11#“Jean Valjean is certainly dead,” said he, “and I am a ninny.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.12#He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of March, 824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of Saint-Médard nd who had been surnamed “the mendicant who gives alms.” This person, the story an, was a man of means, whose name no one knew exactly, and who lived alone ith a little girl of eight years, who knew nothing about herself, save that she ad come from Montfermeil. Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it ade Javert prick up his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom his person had given alms, added a few more details. This gentleman of property as very shy,—never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one, xcept, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach him. He ore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all added with bank-bills. This piqued Javert’s curiosity in a decided manner. In rder to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him, he orrowed the beadle’s outfit for a day, and the place where the old spy was in he habit of crouching every evening, whining orisons through his nose, and laying the spy under cover of prayer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.13#“The suspected individual” did indeed approach Javert thus disguised, and estow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the shock which ean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the one received by avert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.14#However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean’s death was fficial; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt, Javert, the man f scruples, never laid a finger on any one’s collar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.15#He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got “the old woman” to alking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the fact egarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episode of the housand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled it! Javert hired a room; hat evening he installed himself in it. He came and listened at the mysterious odger’s door, hoping to catch the sound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his andle through the key-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.16#On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the fall f the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing the rattling f coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, and made haste to warn avert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javert was waiting for him behind he trees of the boulevard with two men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.17#Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not mentioned he name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was his secret, and he ad kept it for three reasons: in the first place, because the slightest ndiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert; next, because, to lay hands on n ex-convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead, on a criminal whom ustice had formerly classed forever as _among malefactors of the most dangerous ort_, was a magnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police ould assuredly not leave to a newcomer like Javert, and he was afraid of being eprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a aste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded successes which are alked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off. He preferred to laborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the ast.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.18#Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner to orner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single instant; even t the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to be the most secure Javert’s ye had been on him. Why had not Javert arrested Jean Valjean? Because he was till in doubt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.19#It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at ts ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests denounced by he newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, and had rendered the refecture timid. Interference with individual liberty was a grave matter. The olice agents were afraid of making a mistake; the prefect laid the blame on hem; a mistake meant dismissal. The reader can imagine the effect which this rief paragraph, reproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do entleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and onducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.20#Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own; injunctions f his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect. He was really in oubt.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.22#Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of being orced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette and imself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child—all this, ithout his being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean’s walk, and impressed on is bearing such senility, that the police themselves, incarnate in the person f Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake. The impossibility of pproaching too close, his costume of an _émigré_ preceptor, the declaration of hénardier which made a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his eath in prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in avert’s mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.23#For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers; ut if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a good, honest old ellow living on his income, he was probably some merry blade deeply and unningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian misdeeds, some chief of a angerous band, who gave alms to conceal his other talents, which was an old odge. He had trusty fellows, accomplices’ retreats in case of emergencies, in hich he would, no doubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making hrough the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man. o arrest him too hastily would be “to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs.” here was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure that he would not scape.

He speedily divined, however, that Jean aljean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself. He bent is head and reflected like a blood-hound who puts his nose to the ground to ake sure that he is on the right scent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of nstinct, went straight to the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper urnished him with the information which he required: “Have you seen a man with little girl?” “I made him pay two sous,” replied the toll-keeper. Javert eached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated pot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. He saw him nter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot rranged there like a trap, and of the sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the ue Petit-Picpus. _He made sure of his back burrows_, as huntsmen say; he astily despatched one of his agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. patrol which was returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a equisition on it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are ces. Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild boar, ne must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These combinations aving been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caught between the blind lley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and himself, Javert, in the ear, he took a pinch of snuff.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.5.10.29#Then he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment; e allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, but desirous of ostponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happy at the thought that e was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloating over him with his gaze, with hat voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter, and of the at which lets the mouse run.

He was wrong, perhaps, n hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict. The first glance should have ufficed him. He was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old uilding; he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in he Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the ull light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly useful; it s a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve onfidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy nimals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by taking too much thought as to ow he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail, alarmed the beast by iving him wind of the dart, and so made him run. Above all, he was wrong in hat after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he layed that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a hread. He thought himself stronger than he was, and believed that he could play t the game of the mouse and the lion. At the same time, he reckoned himself as oo weak, when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement. Fatal precaution, aste of precious time! Javert committed all these blunders, and nonetheless was ne of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed. He was, in the ull force of the term, what is called in venery a _knowing dog_.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.1#Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate than he carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance, which usually tood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a view of two things, neither f which have anything very funereal about them,—a courtyard surrounded by walls ung with vines, and the face of a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the ottom of the court, tall trees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened he courtyard, when a glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to ass Number 62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling impression f it. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.2#The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.3#If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,—which was even early impossible for every one, for there was an _open sesame!_ which it was ecessary to know,—if, the porter once passed, one entered a little vestibule on he right, on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow hat only one person could ascend it at a time, if one did not allow one’s self o be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which lothed this staircase, if one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first anding, then a second, and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the ellow wash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable ersistency. Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. The orridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this cape, one arrived a ew paces further on, in front of a door which was all the more mysterious ecause it was not fastened. If one opened it, one found one’s self in a little hamber about six feet square, tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with ankin paper with green flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light ell from a large window, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole idth of the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one heard either a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the chamber was not urnished; there was not even a chair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.4#One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular ole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars, black, notted, solid, which formed squares—I had almost said meshes—of less than an nch and a half in diagonal length. The little green flowers of the nankin paper an in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars, without being startled or hrown into confusion by their funereal contact. Supposing that a living being ad been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the quare hole, this grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage f the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the ind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been re-enforced by a heet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, and pierced with a housand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer. At the bottom of his plate, an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a etter box. A bit of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of the rated opening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.5#If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near at and, which made one start.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.8#Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. If ne did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once more, as hough the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of t.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.9#If one knew the password, the voice resumed, “Enter on the right.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.10#One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door urmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and crossing he threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters t the theatre into a grated _baignoire_, before the grating is lowered and the handelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in a sort of theatre-box, narrow, urnished with two old chairs, and a much-frayed straw matting, sparely lluminated by the vague light from the glass door; a regular box, with its ront just of a height to lean upon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box as grated, only the grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it as a monstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the all by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.11#The first minutes passed; when one’s eyes began to grow used to this ellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got no further han six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of black shutters, e-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread ellow. These shutters were divided into long, narrow slats, and they masked the ntire length of the grating. They were always closed. At the expiration of a ew moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters, and aying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.12#“I am here. What do you wish with me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.13#It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible. Hardly he sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a spirit which ad been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.14#If one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions, he slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked spirit became an pparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, one perceived so far as the rating permitted sight, a head, of which only the mouth and the chin were isible; the rest was covered with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black uimpe, and a form that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That ead spoke with you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.15#The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that ou saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was ymbolical.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.16#Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was ade in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness enveloped hat form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness, and sought to ake out the surroundings of the apparition. At the expiration of a very short ime you discovered that you could see nothing. What you beheld was night, mptiness, shadows, a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of errible peace, a silence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a loom in which you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.17#What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.18#It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the onvent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in which you tood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you was that of the ortress who always sat motionless and silent, on the other side of the wall, ear the square opening, screened by the iron grating and the plate with its housand holes, as by a double visor. The obscurity which bathed the grated box rose from the fact that the parlor, which had a window on the side of the orld, had none on the side of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of hat sacred place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.1.19#Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a light; here was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the most strictly alled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way into it, and to take he reader in, and to say, without transgressing the proper bounds, things which tory-tellers have never seen, and have, therefore, never described.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.1#This convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in the ue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience of Martin erga.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.2#These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, like the ernardine monks, but to Cîteaux, like the Benedictine monks. In other words, hey were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint Benoît.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.3#Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that Martin erga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, with Salamanca or the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch establishment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.4#This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic ountries of Europe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.5#There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one order n another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoît, which is here in uestion: there are attached to this order, without counting the obedience of artin Verga, four congregations,—two in Italy, Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine f Padua; two in France, Cluny and Saint-Maur; and nine orders,—Vallombrosa, ranmont, the Célestins, the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humiliés, the livateurs, the Silvestrins, and lastly, Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a trunk or other orders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoît. Cîteaux dates from Saint obert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was in 529 hat the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco—he was old—had he turned ermit?—was chased from the ancient temple of Apollo, where he dwelt, by aint-Benoît, then aged seventeen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.6#After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow on heir throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the ernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black, with a uimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of Saint-Benoît, mounts to he chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a large woollen veil, the guimpe hich mounts to the chin cut square on the breast, the band which descends over heir brow to their eyes,—this is their dress. All is black except the band, hich is white. The novices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed uns also wear a rosary at their side.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.7#The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual doration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, who, at he beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,—one at the Temple, the ther in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. However, the Bernardines-Benedictines f the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking, were a totally different order rom the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, cloistered in the Rue euve-Sainte-Geneviève and at the Temple. There were numerous differences in heir rule; there were some in their costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of he Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy acrament and of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, esides, on their breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver ilt or gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy acrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of the etit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two orders perfectly istinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of the Ladies of the Holy acrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just as there existed a imilarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to he infancy, the life, and death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two rders, which were, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even ostile. The Oratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and he Oratory of France, established by Pierre de Bérulle. The Oratory of France laimed the precedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Bérulle was cardinal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.8#Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.2.9#The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round, bstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are peculiar to hem, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o’clock in the morning, to ead their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all seasons between serge sheets nd on straw, make no use of the bath, never light a fire, scourge themselves very Friday, observe the rule of silence, speak to each other only during the ecreation hours, which are very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months n the year, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, ntil Easter. These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, ut this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers and ervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. Even with this palliation, hen the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September, they suffer from ever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in heir seclusion,—these are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.

As soon as they become aware that they are rowing attached to this object, they must give it up. They recall the words of aint Thérèse, to whom a great lady said, as she was on the point of entering er order, “Permit me, mother, to send for a Bible to which I am greatly ttached.” “Ah, you are attached to something!

Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they ause, and say in a low voice, “Jesus-Marie-Joseph.” For the office of the dead hey adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a epth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.

The _coulpe_ or _peccavi_, is ade for a very small matter—a broken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay f a few seconds at an office, a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, and he _coulpe_ is made. The _coulpe_ is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable erson herself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judges herself nd inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays four mother precentors ntone the offices before a large reading-desk with four places. One day one of he mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with _Ecce_, and instead of Ecce_ she uttered aloud the three notes _do si sol_; for this piece of bsent-mindedness she underwent a _coulpe_ which lasted during the whole ervice: what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had aughed.

One of them said to us one day, “The sight f the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot.” They were dressed in lue, with a white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their reast. On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha’s day, they ere permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to dress themselves as uns and to carry out the offices and practice of Saint-Benoît for a whole day. n the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black arments. This seemed profane, and the prioress forbade it. Only the novices ere permitted to lend. It is remarkable that these performances, tolerated and ncouraged, no doubt, in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and n order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine appiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply amused themselves ith it. _It was new; it gave them a change_. Candid reasons of childhood, which o not, however, succeed in making us worldlings comprehend the felicity of olding a holy water sprinkler in one’s hand and standing for hours together inging hard enough for four in front of a reading-desk.

After the salmodies, the bells, the peals, and knells and offices, the sound of these ittle girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The ive of joy was opened, and each one brought her honey. They played, they called o each other, they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little white eeth chattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from a istance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still they eamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling rilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy t this sweet swarming of the hives. It was like a shower of roses falling thwart this house of mourning. The young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of he nuns; the gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence. Thanks to hese children, there was, among so many austere hours, one hour of ngenuousness. The little ones skipped about; the elder ones danced. In this loister play was mingled with heaven.

He had been a mousquetaire, and then, e was said to be very coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well ressed in a roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent oire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.5.18#It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always layed the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,—“My Zétulbé, come eign o’er my soul,”—and it was heard two or three times a day. The young girls assed hours in listening to it, the vocal mothers were upset by it, brains were usy, punishments descended in showers. This lasted for several months. The irls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed hat she was Zétulbé. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the ue Droit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything, ttempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only for a econd, of the “young man” who played that flute so deliciously, and who, no oubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There were some who made heir escape by a back door, and ascended to the third story on the Rue roit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps. mpossible! One even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and o wave her white handkerchief. Two were still bolder. They found means to climb n a roof, and risked their lives there, and succeeded at last in seeing “the oung man.” He was an old _émigré_ gentleman, blind and penniless, who was laying his flute in his attic, in order to pass the time.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.1#In this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly distinct uildings,—the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, the Boarding-school, where he scholars were lodged; and lastly, what was called the Little Convent. It was building with a garden, in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various rders, the relics of cloisters destroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all he black, gray, and white medleys of all communities and all possible arieties; what might be called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a ort of harlequin convent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.2#When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and exiled omen had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of he Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid them a small pension, the adies of the Petit-Picpus received them cordially. It was a singular pell-mell. ach followed her own rule. Sometimes the pupils of the boarding-school were llowed, as a great recreation, to pay them a visit; the result is, that all hose young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of Mother ainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.3#One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun of ainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient convent of he ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, his very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged later to the Benedictines of artin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her rder, which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a ittle manikin, which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to he house at her death. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, here remains only a doll.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.4#In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had obtained ermission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire into the Little onvent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort d’Hautpoul and Marquise Dufresne. nother was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she ade when she blew her nose. The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini hubbub).
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.5#About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing a little eriodical publication called _l’Intrépide_, asked to be allowed to enter the onvent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Duc d’Orléans recommended her. proar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were all in a flutter; Madame de Genlis ad made romances. But she declared that she was the first to detest them, and hen, she had reached her fierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of he Prince, she entered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, lleging as a reason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were elighted. Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very ell.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.6#When she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis was uperstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably good profile f her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in the inside of a ittle cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her ewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her own hand in red ink on ellow paper, and which, in her opinion, possessed the property of frightening way robbers:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.7#Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis: Dismas et Gesmas, media est ivina potestas; Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas; Nos et res nostras onservet summa potestas. Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.15
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.8#These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the two hieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas and Gestas, or ismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded the pretensions put orward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, of a descent from the icked thief. However, the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an rticle of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.6.9#The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate the reat Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment, was, of ourse, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and the Little onvent. The public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the treet. But all was so arranged, that none of the inhabitants of the cloister ould see a face from the outside world. Suppose a church whose choir is grasped n a gigantic hand, and folded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary hurches, a prolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure ellar, to the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut off y a curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken; in the hadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the eft, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and the novices at the ottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus assisting at ivine service. That cavern, which was called the choir, communicated with the loister by a lobby. The church was lighted from the garden. When the nuns were resent at services where their rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of heir presence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and alling.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.7.1#During the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of the etit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion, was Mother nnocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur, author of _Lives of he Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoît_. She had been re-elected. She was a oman about sixty years of age, short, thick, “singing like a cracked pot,” says he letter which we have already quoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the nly merry one in the whole convent, and for that reason adored. She was earned, erudite, wise, competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed with atin, stuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictine monk than a enedictine nun.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.7.2#The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almost lind.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.7.5#Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, was fond f making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took a complete scale f them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen years of age, inclusive, of ssorted voices and sizes, whom she made sing standing, drawn up in a line, side y side, according to age, from the smallest to the largest. This presented to he eye, something in the nature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living an-pipe made of angels.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.7.6#Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were Sister uphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguérite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was in her otage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.

No fire was lighted except in the school, and the food was hoice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they lavished a thousand cares n their scholars. Only, when a child passed near a nun and addressed her, the un never replied.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.7.8#This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the whole onvent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowed on nanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it was the ardener’s bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the portress, and which was udible throughout the house, indicated by its varied peals, which formed a sort f acoustic telegraph, all the actions of material life which were to be erformed, and summoned to the parlor, in case of need, such or such an nhabitant of the house. Each person and each thing had its own peal. The rioress had one and one, the sub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced essons, so that the pupils never said “to go to lessons,” but “to go to ix-five.” Four-four was Madame de Genlis’s signal. It was very often heard.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.8.1#After having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitable to oint out, in a few words, its material configuration. The reader already has ome idea of it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.8.2#The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole of he vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue Polonceau, he Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane, called Rue umarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat. he convent was composed of several buildings and a garden. The principal uilding, taken in its entirety, was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions hich, viewed from a bird’s-eye view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a ibbet laid flat on the ground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of he fragment of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the ue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated façade which aced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its extremity. owards the centre of this façade was a low, arched door, whitened with dust and shes, where the spiders wove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or wo on Sundays, and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the onvent. This was the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was square hall which was used as the servants’ hall, and which the nuns called the buttery_. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers, the sisters, and he novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the refectory, backed up by the loisters and the church. Between the door No. 62 and the corner of the closed umarais Lane, was the school, which was not visible from without. The remainder f the trapezium formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the ue Polonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than n the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the ummit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree, whence ran, as from he peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twos in between he branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if the enclosure had been ircular, the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross uperposed on a wheel. As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of he garden, they were of unequal length. They were bordered with currant bushes. t the bottom, an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, hich was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, hich was at the angle of the Aumarais Lane. In front of the Little Convent was hat was called the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a ourtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison alls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue olonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to form or himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of the etit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house had been built on the precise ite of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which as called the “tennis-ground of the eleven thousand devils.”

These names, roit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them are very uch more ancient still.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.9.1#Since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the etit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to open a window on hat discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one other little digression, tterly foreign to this book, but characteristic and useful, since it shows that he cloister even has its original figures.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.9.2#In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey of ontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. She talked a reat deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under Louis XVI. and of a residentess Duplat, with whom she had been very intimate. It was her pleasure nd her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext. She told wonders of the bbey of Fontevrault,—that it was like a city, and that there were streets in he monastery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.9.3#She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year, she olemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath, she said to the riest, “Monseigneur Saint-François gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Julien, onseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur aint-Eusebius gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I ive it to you, father.” And the school-girls would begin to laugh, not in their leeves, but under their veils; charming little stifled laughs which made the ocal mothers frown.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.9.4#On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said that _in er youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires_. It as a century which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth century. She old about the custom of the four wines, which existed before the Revolution in hampagne and Bourgogne. When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, duke, and a peer, traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers ame out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which hey had poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this nscription could be read, _monkey wine_; on the second, _lion wine_; on the hird, _sheep wine_; on the fourth, _hog wine_. These four legends express the our stages descended by the drunkard; the first, intoxication, which enlivens; he second, that which irritates; the third, that which dulls; and the fourth, hat which brutalizes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.9.5#In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of which he thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this. She would ot show this object to anyone. She shut herself up, which her rule allowed her o do, and hid herself, every time that she desired to contemplate it. If she eard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it as possible with her aged hands. As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became ilent, she who was so fond of talking. The most curious were baffled by her ilence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of omment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could hat treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret? Some oly book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic? They lost hemselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died, they rushed to her upboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and opened it. They found the bject beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecrated paten. It was a aenza platter representing little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary ads armed with enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical ostures. One of the charming little Loves is already fairly spitted. He is esisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the ancer is laughing with a satanical air. Moral: Love conquered by the colic. his platter, which is very curious, and which had, possibly, the honor of urnishing Molière with an idea, was still in existence in September, 1845; it as for sale by a bric-à-brac merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.10.1#However, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought to convey n idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity n other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple, in particular, which elonged, in truth, to another order, the black shutters were replaced by brown urtains, and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor, whose indows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts f frames, a portrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, nd even the head of a Turk.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.10.2#It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous hestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in France, and hich bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of eing _the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.10.3#As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines of he Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who depended on îteaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very ancient and does not o back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on wo occasions a few days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and t Saint-Jean en Grève, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town n an uproar. M. the Prior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Prés ordered a olemn procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope’s Nuncio officiated. But his expiation did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de oucs, and the Comtesse de Châteauvieux. This outrage committed on “the most oly sacrament of the altar,” though but temporary, would not depart from these oly souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a Perpetual Adoration” in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the ther in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called f the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this ious end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoît; the first permission for his foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbé of aint-Germain, “on condition that no woman could be received unless she ontributed three hundred livres income, which amounts to six thousand livres, o the principal.” After the Abbé of Saint-Germain, the king accorded etters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters, was onfirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.10.4#Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the enedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris. Their irst convent was “a new building” in the Rue Cassette, out of the contributions f Mesdames de Boucs and de Châteauvieux.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.10.5#This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with the enedictine nuns of Cîteaux. It mounted back to the Abbé of Saint-Germain des rés, in the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred Heart go back to the eneral of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity to the general of the azarists.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.10.6#It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus, hose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. had authorized, y a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus, to practise the erpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the Holy Sacrament. But the two rders remained distinct nonetheless.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.11.head#CHAPTER XI—END OF THE PETIT-PICPUS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.11.1#At the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus was in ts decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order, which, after the ighteenth century, has been disappearing like all the religious orders. ontemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity’s needs; but, like everything hich the Revolution touched, it will be transformed, and from being hostile to ocial progress, it will become favorable to it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.11.2#The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In 1840, he Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. There were no onger any old women, nor young girls; the first were dead, the latter had taken heir departure. _Volaverunt_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.6.11.3#The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it larms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In 1845, it till obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed nuns, none at all. orty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred; fifteen years ago there ere not more than twenty-eight of them. How many are there to-day? In 1847, the rioress was young, a sign that the circle of choice was restricted. She was not orty years old. In proportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, he service of each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawing ear when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the heavy ule of Saint-Benoît. The burden is implacable, and remains the same for the few s for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. At the period when he author of this book still lived in Paris, two died. One was twenty-five ears old, the other twenty-three. This latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: “Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres.” _ It is in consequence of this decay hat the convent gave up the education of girls.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.head#CHAPTER II—THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.1#From the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticism is ondemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in its irculation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness where centres of labor hould exist. Monastic communities are to the great social community what the istletoe is to the oak, what the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity nd their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, ood at the beginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by he spiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover, when it ecomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period of disorder, it becomes bad or the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity, because t still continues to set the example.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.2#Claustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education of odern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injurious to its evelopment. So far as institution and formation with relation to man are oncerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century, questionable in he fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. The leprosy of monasticism has nawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations, Italy and Spain; the one the ight, the other the splendor of Europe for centuries; and, at the present day, hese two illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks to he healthy and vigorous hygiene of 1789 alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.3#The convent—the ancient female convent in particular, such as it still resents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria, in pain—is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. The cloister, hat cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. The Catholic cloister, roperly speaking, is wholly filled with the black radiance of death.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.4#The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, in obscurity, eneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague with shadow, massive ltars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immense white crucifixes hang from hains in the dark; there are extended, all nude on the ebony, great Christs of vory; more than bleeding,—bloody; hideous and magnificent, with their elbows isplaying the bones, their knee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds howing their flesh, crowned with silver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with lood drops of rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The iamonds and rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep, heir sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges, their reasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with prayer; women ho think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves seraphim. Do these omen think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they love? No. Do they live? No. heir nerves have turned to bone; their bones have turned to stone. Their veil s of woven night. Their breath under their veil resembles the indescribably ragic respiration of death. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and errifies them. The immaculate one is there, and very fierce. Such are the ncient monasteries of Spain. Liars of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins, erocious places.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.5#Catholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent was, bove all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orient about t. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and kept watch over this eraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun was the odalisque, the priest was he eunuch. The fervent were chosen in dreams and possessed Christ. At night, he beautiful, nude young man descended from the cross and became the ecstasy of he cloistered one. Lofty walls guarded the mystic sultana, who had the rucified for her sultan, from all living distraction. A glance on the outer orld was infidelity. The _in pace_ replaced the leather sack. That which was ast into the sea in the East was thrown into the ground in the West. In both uarters, women wrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for the ast; here the drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.6#To-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, have adopted he expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashion a strange and easy anner of suppressing the revelations of history, of invalidating the ommentaries of philosophy, of eliding all embarrassing facts and all gloomy uestions. _A matter for declamations_, say the clever. Declamations, repeat the oolish. Jean-Jacques a declaimer; Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas, abarre, and Sirven, declaimers. I know not who has recently discovered that acitus was a declaimer, that Nero was a victim, and that pity is decidedly due o “that poor Holofernes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.2.7#Facts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they are obstinate. he author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eight leagues distant from russels,—there are relics of the Middle Ages there which are attainable for verybody,—at the Abbey of Villers, the hole of the oubliettes, in the middle of he field which was formerly the courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of he Thil, four stone dungeons, half under ground, half under the water. They ere _in pace_. Each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, nd a grated opening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of the iver, and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground. Four feet of iver flow past along the outside wall. The ground is always soaked. The ccupant of the _in pace_ had this wet soil for his bed. In one of these ungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to the wall; in nother, there can be seen a square box made of four slabs of granite, too short or a person to lie down in, too low for him to stand upright in. A human being as put inside, with a coverlid of stone on top. This exists. It can be seen. It an be touched. These _in pace_, these dungeons, these iron hinges, these ecklets, that lofty peep-hole on a level with the river’s current, that box of tone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb, with this difference, that the ead man here was a living being, that soil which is but mud, that vault hole, hose oozing walls,—what declaimers!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.head#CHAPTER III—ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.1#Monasticism, such as it existed in Spain, and such as it still exists in hibet, is a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short. It simply epopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the scourge of Europe. Add to his the violence so often done to the conscience, the forced vocations, eudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the right of the first-born pouring the xcess of the family into monasticism, the ferocities of which we have just poken, the _in pace_, the closed mouths, the walled-up brains, so many nfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows, the taking of the abit, the interment of living souls. Add individual tortures to national egradations, and, whoever you may be, you will shudder before the frock and the eil,—those two winding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain oints and in certain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the pirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, and a ingular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, astonishing the civilized orld. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves esembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which should claim our hair, he pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten, the ersecution of the child’s garment which should insist on clothing the man, the enderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.2#“Ingrates!” says the garment, “I protected you in inclement weather. Why ill you have nothing to do with me?” “I have just come from the deep sea,” says he fish. “I have been a rose,” says the perfume. “I have loved you,” says the orpse. “I have civilized you,” says the convent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.3#To this there is but one reply: “In former days.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.4#To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of the overnment of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition, to regild hrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, to refurnish uperstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put new handles on holy water rushes and militarism, to reconstitute monasticism and militarism, to believe n the salvation of society by the multiplication of parasites, to force the ast on the present,—this seems strange. Still, there are theorists who hold uch theories. These theorists, who are in other respects people of ntelligence, have a very simple process; they apply to the past a glazing which hey call social order, divine right, morality, family, the respect of elders, ntique authority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go about houting, “Look! take this, honest people.” This logic was known to the ncients. The soothsayers practise it. They rubbed a black heifer over with halk, and said, “She is white, _Bos cretatus_.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.5#As for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, above all, rovided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on being alive, we attack t, and we try to kill it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.6#Superstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms, all orms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails in their moke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war must be made on hem, and that without truce; for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be ondemned to eternal combat with phantoms. It is difficult to seize darkness by he throat, and to hurl it to the earth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.7#A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, is a ollege of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very act of sceticism, in the very heart of the city of ’89 and of 1830 and of 1848, Rome lossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinary times, in order to issolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish, one has only to make it spell ut the date. But we are not in ordinary times.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.8#Let us fight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.9#Let us fight, but let us make a distinction. The peculiar property of truth s never to commit excesses. What need has it of exaggeration? There is that hich it is necessary to destroy, and there is that which it is simply necessary o elucidate and examine. What a force is kindly and serious examination! Let us ot apply a flame where only a light is required.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.3.10#So, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a general roposition, and among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe, in India as ell as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. Whoever says cloister, says marsh. heir putrescence is evident, their stagnation is unhealthy, their fermentation nfects people with fever, and etiolates them; their multiplication becomes a lague of Egypt. We cannot think without affright of those lands where fakirs, onzes, santons, Greek monks, marabouts, talapoins, and dervishes multiply even ike swarms of vermin.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.4.5#They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renounce the orld, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests. They are lothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them possesses in his own ight anything whatever. On entering there, each one who was rich makes himself oor. What he has, he gives to all. He who was what is called noble, a gentleman nd a lord, is the equal of him who was a peasant. The cell is identical for ll. All undergo the same tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black read, sleep on the same straw, die on the same ashes. The same sack on their acks, the same rope around their loins. If the decision has been to go arefoot, all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince is the ame shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names have disappeared. They ear only first names. All are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names. hey have dissolved the carnal family, and constituted in their community a piritual family. They have no other relatives than all men. They succor the oor, they care for the sick. They elect those whom they obey. They call each ther “my brother.”

The Middle Ages cast aside, Asia cast aside, the istorical and political question held in reserve, from the purely philosophical oint of view, outside the requirements of militant policy, on condition that he monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only onsenting parties, I shall always consider a cloistered community with a ertain attentive, and, in some respects, a deferential gravity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.4.9#Wherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is a ommune, there is right.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.5.4#To pray to God,—what is the meaning of these words?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.5.5#Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent, ermanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because, if it acked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, since it is nfinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would end there? Does this nfinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves nly the idea of existence? In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we re only the relative?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.5.6#At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not an nfinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming plural!) uperposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second infinite, so to speak, ubjacent to the first? Is it not the latter’s mirror, reflection, echo, an byss which is concentric with another abyss? Is this second infinity ntelligent also? Does it think? Does it love? Does it will? If these two nfinities are intelligent, each of them has a will principle, and there is an I_ in the upper infinity as there is an _I_ in the lower infinity. The _I_ elow is the soul; the _I_ on high is God.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.7.5.7#To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought, with he infinity on high, is called praying.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.1#It was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressed it, fallen from the sky.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.2#He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue olonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the ight, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had caught a glimpse n the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he had seen stretched on the round was the sister who was making reparation; that bell, the sound of which ad so strangely surprised him, was the gardener’s bell attached to the knee of ather Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.3#Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we have lready seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good, rackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by Cosette, each hrew himself on a truss of straw.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.4#Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: “I must remain here enceforth.” This remark trotted through Fauchelevent’s head all night long.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.5#To tell the truth, neither of them slept.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.6#Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on his cent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to Paris. Then he new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister. ean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,—to remain there. Now, for an nfortunate man in his position, this convent was both the safest and the most angerous of places; the most dangerous, because, as no men might enter there, f he were discovered, it was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find ut one step intervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if e could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would ever eek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was safety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.7#On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by declaring o himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had M. Madeleine got here, when the walls were what they were? Cloister walls are not to be stepped ver. How did he get there with a child? One cannot scale a perpendicular wall ith a child in one’s arms. Who was that child? Where did they both come from? ince Fauchelevent had lived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., nd he knew nothing of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air hich discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself: “One oes not question a saint.” M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in auchelevent’s eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall, the ardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably ecome bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was pursued by his reditors; or that he had compromised himself in some political affair, and was n hiding; which last did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our easants of the North, had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in iding, M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite imple that he should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which auchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that . Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with him. auchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still did not believe it ossible. The incomprehensible had just made its entrance into Fauchelevent’s ut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly ut this: “M. Madeleine saved my life.” This certainty alone was sufficient and ecided his course. He said to himself: “It is my turn now.” He added in his onscience: “M. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of hrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out.” He made up is mind to save M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.8#Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers eplies: “After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief? Just he same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same. Since he is a aint, shall I save him? Just the same.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.9#But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent! auchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking; his poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than his self-devotion, is good will, and a little of that old rustic cunning, on this occasion nlisted in the service of a generous enterprise, undertook to scale the ifficulties of the cloister, and the steep escarpments of the rule of aint-Benoît. Father Fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his ife, and who, towards the end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left o him in the world, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous ction to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when e is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had ever tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add, that the air which e had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in im, and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary o him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.10#So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.11#We have just called him a _poor peasant of Picardy_. That description is ust, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now reached, a ittle of Father Fauchelevent’s physiology becomes useful. He was a peasant, but e had been a notary, which added trickery to his cunning, and penetration to is ingenuousness. Having, through various causes, failed in his business, he ad descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths nd lashings, which horses seem to require, something of the notary had lingered n him. He had some natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is rare thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: “He talks almost ike a gentleman with a hat.” Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species, hich the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout_, and which the metaphors showered by the château pon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: _rather ustic, rather citified; pepper and salt_. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and arshly used by fate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, evertheless, an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a recious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his ices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy was of he kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none of those isagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify malice or tupidity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.12#At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an normous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss of straw, nd watching Cosette’s slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.13#“Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.14#This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his everie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.15#The two men took counsel together.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.16#“In the first place,” said Fauchelevent, “you will begin by not setting oot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the garden nd we are done for.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.17#“That is true.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.18#“Monsieur Madeleine,” resumed Fauchelevent, “you have arrived at a very uspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of the ladies s very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our direction. It seems hat she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours are being said. The whole ommunity is in confusion. That occupies them. The one who is on the point of eparture is a saint. In fact, we are all saints here; all the difference etween them and me is that they say ‘our cell,’ and that I say ‘my cabin.’ The rayers for the dying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We hall be at peace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.19#“Still,” observed Jean Valjean, “this cottage is in the niche of the wall, t is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visible from the onvent.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.20#“And I add that the nuns never come near it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.21#“Well?” said Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.22#The interrogation mark which accentuated this “well” signified: “it seems o me that one may remain concealed here?” It was to this interrogation point hat Fauchelevent responded:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.23#“There are the little girls.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.24#“What little girls?” asked Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.25#Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had ttered, a bell emitted one stroke.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.26#“The nun is dead,” said he. “There is the knell.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.27#And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.28#The bell struck a second time.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.29#“It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike nce a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the hurch.—You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll side, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to hunt and rummage or it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.30#“Who?” asked Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.31#“The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They would hriek: ‘Oh! a man!’ There is no danger to-day. There will be no recreation our. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear the bell. As I told ou, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.32#“I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.33#And Jean Valjean thought to himself:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.34#“Here is Cosette’s education already provided.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.35#Fauchelevent exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.36#“Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you! nd they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You see how hey fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.37#Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.—“This convent would e our salvation,” he murmured.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.38#Then he raised his voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.39#“Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.40#“No,” said Fauchelevent, “the difficulty is to get out.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.41#Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.42#“To get out!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.43#“Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary to et out.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.44#And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded, auchelevent went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.45#“You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me, you all from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to enter by the oor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.46#All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.47#“Ah!” said Fauchelevent, “they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They are oing to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies. She died at aybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot you get out by the way n which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but ow did you get in?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.48#Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into that errible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a forest filled with igers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to eturn thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still ngaged in swarming in that quarter, agents on the watch, sentinels everywhere, rightful fists extended towards his collar, Javert at the corner of the ntersection of the streets perhaps.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.49#“Impossible!” said he. “Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the ky.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.50#“But I believe it, I believe it,” retorted Fauchelevent. “You have no need o tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of etting a good look at you close to, and then dropped you. Only, he meant to lace you in a man’s convent; he made a mistake. Come, there goes another peal, hat is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the ead-doctor is to come here and view a corpse. All that is the ceremony of ying. These good ladies are not at all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man ho does not believe in anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts omething else too. How quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! hat is the matter? Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.51#“Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.52#“She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.54#“It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service door hich opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have my vintage asket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father Fauchelevent goes out ith his basket—that is perfectly natural. You will tell the child to keep very uiet. She will be under the cover. I will leave her for whatever time is equired with a good old friend, a fruit-seller whom I know in the Rue hemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who has a little bed. I will shout in the ruit-seller’s ear, that she is a niece of mine, and that she is to keep her for e until to-morrow. Then the little one will re-enter with you; for I will ontrive to have you re-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get ut?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.55#Jean Valjean shook his head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.56#“No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent. Find ome means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.57#Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his eft hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.58#A third peal created a diversion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.59#“That is the dead-doctor taking his departure,” said Fauchelevent. “He has aken a look and said: ‘She is dead, that is well.’ When the doctor has signed he passport for paradise, the undertaker’s company sends a coffin. If it is a other, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister, the sisters lay her out. fter which, I nail her up. That forms a part of my gardener’s duty. A gardener s a bit of a grave-digger. She is placed in a lower hall of the church which ommunicates with the street, and into which no man may enter save the doctor of he dead. I don’t count the undertaker’s men and myself as men. It is in that all that I nail up the coffin. The undertaker’s men come and get it, and whip p, coachman! that’s the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with nothing n it, they take it away again with something in it. That’s what a burial is ike. _De profundis_.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.60#A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping osette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an angel rinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her. He was no onger listening to Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.1.61#That one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The good ld gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:—

It is an ancient cemetery which is utside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is going to retire. It s a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend there, Father Mestienne, the rave-digger. The nuns here possess one privilege, it is to be taken to that emetery at nightfall. There is a special permission from the Prefecture on heir behalf. But how many events have happened since yesterday! Mother rucifixion is dead, and Father Madeleine—”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.2.1#It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions, notably riests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions. At the oment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of preoccupation was mprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was that wise and charming ademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who was ordinarily cheerful.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.2.2#The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. The rioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.2.14#Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of peasants ho have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you do not istrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a success during he something more than two years which he had passed in the convent. Always olitary and busied about his gardening, he had nothing else to do than to ndulge his curiosity. As he was at a distance from all those veiled women assing to and fro, he saw before him only an agitation of shadows. By dint of ttention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with lesh, and those corpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose sight rows keener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute. He had pplied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals, and he ad succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no ecrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent new all and concealed all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought im stupid. A great merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of auchelevent. He was a curious mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was egular, and never went out except for well-demonstrated requirements of the rchard and vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inured to his redit. Nonetheless, he had set two men to chattering: the porter, in the onvent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at he cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture; n this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns, one as to heir life, the other as to their death. But he did not abuse his knowledge. The ongregation thought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, robably a little deaf into the bargain,—what qualities! They would have found t difficult to replace him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.2.15#The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is ppreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the everend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, his infirmities, the urcharge of years counting double for him henceforth, of the increasing demands f his work, of the great size of the garden, of nights which must be passed, ike the last, for instance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the elon beds, because of the moon, and he wound up as follows: “That he had a rother”—(the prioress made a movement),—“a brother no longer young”—(a second ovement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),—“that, f he might be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and help im, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive from im good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother were not dmitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken and that he was nsufficient for the work, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go way; and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, ho might be reared for God in the house, and who might, who knows, become a nun ome day.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.75#The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, hen raised her voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.76#“In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she ill perform miracles.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.77#“She will!” replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving ot to flinch again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.78#“Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. No oubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de Bérulle, while aying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, while pronouncing hese words: _Hanc igitur oblationem_. But without attaining to such happiness, other Crucifixion’s death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to he very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us er last commands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in er cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled. We elt that she was regaining her life in God. There was something of paradise in hat death.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.79#Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.85#“Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the arden.”

On he day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in his body any dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he halted in front of he first tree which he came to, harangued it and made very great efforts to onvince it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.141#“I have on my right Benoît and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The irst abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest ecause it gave him birth. His father was named Técelin, and his mother Alèthe. e began at Cîteaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of hâlon-sur-Saône, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and ounded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of ens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of rring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, arted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the ouncil of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Poréa, Bishop of oitiers, caused the condemnation of Éon de l‘Étoile, arranged the disputes of rinces, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated he Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles uring his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoît? He as the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Sainteté laustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, wo hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four housand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, orty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in xistence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other he agent of the sanitary department! On one side Saint Benoît, on the other the nspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public ndertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There s not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. e have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary epartment is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the commissary of olice; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.3.143#“No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics and hose in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We do not know hat which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore. We re ignorant and impious. In this age there exist people who do not distinguish etween the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernard denominated of the oor Catholics, a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. thers are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross f Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There is no onger just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of César e Bus. Nevertheless, César de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one f unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Périgord, did not ven know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and François Bourgoin to ondren, and Jean-François Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to ean-François Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because he was one f the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but because he furnished enri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material for an oath. That which pleases eople of the world in Saint François de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And hen, religion is attacked. Why? Because there have been bad priests, because agittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and ecause both of them followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? oes that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his loak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth. arkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind. No ne thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! By order of the king ignifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to he living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. his is horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre otaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating nd rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and he supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Châlons, held his own in this atter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. n former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The bbot of Cîteaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to he parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the body f Saint Benoît himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint enoît-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 1st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor salm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest yet more ny one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read Arnoul Wion, abriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d’Achery.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.1#The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man; hey do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent was in a ilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the arden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire. At the oment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the intner’s basket on the wall, and saying to her, “Listen attentively to me, my ittle Cosette. We must go away from this house, but we shall return to it, and e shall be very happy here. The good man who lives here is going to carry you ff on his back in that. You will wait for me at a lady’s house. I shall come to etch you. Obey, and say nothing, above all things, unless you want Madame hénardier to get you again!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.12#Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying, Impossible.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.13#Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.14#“There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would put arth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the corpse will ot seem like the real thing, it won’t do, it will get displaced, it will move bout. The men will bear it. You understand, Father Madeleine, the government ill notice it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.15#Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was aving.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.18#Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a ervice which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That it fell mong his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up the coffins nd helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun who had died that orning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed, nd interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel. That the police egulations forbade this, but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is efused. That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of he deceased. That it was so much the worse for the government. That he, auchelevent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the hapel, and lower the corpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the rioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as a upil. That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That he prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening, after he counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could not bring M. adeleine in from the outside if M.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.77#What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple matter o Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than this. Any man who as been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of he escape. The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a risis which saves or kills him. An escape is a cure. What does not a man ndergo for the sake of a cure? To have himself nailed up in a case and carried ff like a bale of goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where here is none, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without ying—this was one of Jean Valjean’s gloomy talents.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.78#Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,—that convict’s expedient,—is lso an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk Austin Castillejo, this as the means employed by Charles the Fifth, desirous of seeing the Plombes for he last time after his abdication.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.87#And Jean Valjean added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.88#“Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be caught ere, or accept this escape through the hearse.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.89#Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging etween the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who has not said to a at, “Do come in!” There are men who, when an incident stands half-open before hem, have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions, at he risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate. he over-prudent, cats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur ore danger than the audacious. Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature. But ean Valjean’s coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself. He rumbled:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.91#Jean Valjean resumed:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.4.93#“That is the very point that is not troublesome,” exclaimed Fauchelevent. If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure of getting you ut of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard, and a friend of mine. He is ather Mestienne. An old fellow of the old school. The grave-digger puts the orpses in the grave, and I put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you hat will take place. They will arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of n hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive irectly up to the grave. I shall follow; that is my business. I shall have a ammer, a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, the ndertaker’s men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down. The priest ays the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and akes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I ell you. One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not e sober. If he is not drunk, I shall say to him: ‘Come and drink a bout while he _Bon Coing_ [the Good Quince] is open.’ I carry him off, I get him drunk,—it oes not take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning f it about him,—I lay him under the table, I take his card, so that I can get nto the cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no longer any ne but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: ‘Be off; I will do our work for you.’ Off he goes, and I drag you out of the hole.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.1#On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passers-by on he Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned hearse, rnamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears. This hearse contained a coffin overed with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross, like a huge orpse with drooping arms. A mourning-coach, in which could be seen a priest in is surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed. Two undertaker’s men in ray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse. ehind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who limped along. The rocession was going in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.2#The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennæ of a air of pincers were visible, protruding from the man’s pocket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.3#The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris. t had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance and its house oor, which old people in the quarter, who clung tenaciously to ancient words, till called the _porte cavalière_ and the _porte piétonne_.16 The ernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we ave already stated, to be buried there in a corner apart, and at night, the lot of land having formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers eing thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in his cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of the aris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipal egulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest. The carriage ate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates, adjoining a pavilion uilt by the architect Perronet, and inhabited by the door-keeper of the emetery. These gates, therefore, swung inexorably on their hinges at the nstant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If any rave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one ay for him to get out—his grave-digger’s card furnished by the department of ublic funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter’s window. he grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it fall, ulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man had not his card, he entioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and asleep, rose, came ut and identified the man, and opened the gate with his key; the grave-digger tepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.4#This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, embarrassed he symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed a little later than 1830. he cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the Eastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and nherited that famous dram-shop next to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was urmounted by a quince painted on a board, and which formed an angle, one side n the drinkers’ tables, and the other on the tombs, with this sign: _Au Bon oing_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.5#The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. It was alling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were deserting it. he bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard; it hinted t poverty. Père-Lachaise if you please! to be buried in Père-Lachaise is quivalent to having furniture of mahogany. It is recognized as elegant. The augirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure, planted like an old-fashioned rench garden. Straight alleys, box, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath ged cypress-trees, and very tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there. here were very lugubrious lines about it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.6#The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black ross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man who followed it as no other than Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.7#The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the exit f Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,—all had been xecuted without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.8#Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the ltar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It is one of he faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it, not only without ifficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences. In the loister, what is called the “government” is only an intermeddling with uthority, an interference which is always questionable. In the first place, the ule; as for the code, we shall see. Make as many laws as you please, men; but eep them for yourselves. The tribute to Cæsar is never anything but the emnants of the tribute to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a rinciple.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.9#Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of ind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent, the other gainst it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, to all appearance. Jean aljean’s composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are ontagious. Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.10#What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years, he ad made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at least ten imes. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked with him. He made im dance according to his whim. Mestienne’s head adjusted itself to the cap of auchelevent’s will. Fauchelevent’s confidence was perfect.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.11#At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery, auchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half aloud, as he rubbed is big hands:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.5.13#All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission for nterment must be exhibited. The undertaker’s man addressed himself to the orter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is productive of a elay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger, came and placed himself ehind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was a sort of laboring man, who wore waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.

An offer of a drink as the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave-digger, nd it was necessary to make this offer, but the old gardener left the roverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais in the dark, and that not nintentionally.

Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had been rogressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day. He, like auchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.31#“Come along and drink,” he cried, “since it is I who pays the bill.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.36#At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over, and he pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent’s wild gaze fell mechanically nto that pocket, and there it stopped.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.37#The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still light nough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that awning pocket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.38#The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain, raversed Fauchelevent’s pupils. An idea had just occurred to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.39#He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the grave-digger, ho was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth, observing it, and pulled out he white object which lay at the bottom of it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.43#The grave-digger paused.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.50#“Ah! my card?” said the grave-digger.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.51#And he fumbled in his pocket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.52#Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed on o his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.55#The grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.60#“Ah, come now, conscript,” said Fauchelevent, “none of this despair. There s no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave. Fifteen francs is ifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able to pay it. I am an old hand, ou are a new one. I know all the ropes and the devices. I will give you some riendly advice.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.73#The grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and set off n a run.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.74#When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened until e heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned over the grave, nd said in a low tone:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.75#“Father Madeleine!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.76#There was no reply.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.77#Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbed nto the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.78#“Are you there?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.79#Silence in the coffin.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.80#Fauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized his old chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.81#Jean Valjean’s face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyes ere closed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.82#Fauchelevent’s hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet, then ell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the coffin. He stared t Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.83#Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.84#Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.85#“He is dead!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.86#And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that his lenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.87#“And this is the way I save his life!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.88#Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is an rror to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion often talks loud.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.89#“It is Father Mestienne’s fault. Why did that fool die? What need was here for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting t? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine! He is in the coffin. t is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any sense in these things? Ah! my od! he is dead! Well! and his little girl, what am I to do with her? What will he fruit-seller say? The idea of its being possible for a man like that to die ike this! When I think how he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! ather Madeleine! Pardine! He was suffocated, I said so. He wouldn’t believe me. ell! Here’s a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very best an out of all the good God’s good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In the first lace, I won’t go back there myself. I shall stay here. After having done such a hing as that! What’s the use of being two old men, if we are two old fools! ut, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent? That was the eginning of it all. One should not do such things. Father Madeleine! Father adeleine! Father Madeleine! Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! e does not hear me. Now get out of this scrape if you can!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.90#And he tore his hair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.91#A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It was he cemetery gate closing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.92#Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, and all at once he bounded back and ecoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.93#Jean Valjean’s eyes were open and gazing at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.94#To see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as much o. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by all these xcesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a ead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.95#“I fell asleep,” said Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.96#And he raised himself to a sitting posture.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.97#Fauchelevent fell on his knees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.98#“Just, good Virgin! How you frightened me!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.99#Then he sprang to his feet and cried:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.100#“Thanks, Father Madeleine!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.101#Jean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.102#Joy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in ecovering himself as Jean Valjean had.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.103#“So you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much that you ame back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: ‘Good! there he is, stifled,’ I hould have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait jacket. They would have put e in Bicêtre. What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead? And our little girl? There’s that fruit-seller,—she would never have understood it! he child is thrust into your arms, and then—the grandfather is dead! What a tory! good saints of paradise, what a tale!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.104#“I am cold,” said Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.105#This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there was ressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even when they had ecovered themselves, although they did not realize it, and there was about them omething uncanny, which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the lace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.106#“Let us get out of here quickly,” exclaimed Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.107#He fumbled in his pocket, and pulled out a gourd with which he had rovided himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.108#“But first, take a drop,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.109#The flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed a outhful of brandy, and regained full possession of his faculties.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.110#He got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid gain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.111#Three minutes later they were out of the grave.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.112#Moreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. The emetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to be pprehended. That “conscript” was at home busily engaged in looking for his ard, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings, since it was in auchelevent’s pocket. Without a card, he could not get back into the emetery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.113#Fauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, and together hey buried the empty coffin.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.114#When the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.115#“Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.116#Night was falling.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.117#Jean Valjean experienced some difficulty in moving and in walking. He had tiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like a corpse. The igidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks. He had, in a anner, to thaw out, from the tomb.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.118#“You are benumbed,” said Fauchelevent. “It is a pity that I have a game eg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.119#“Bah!” replied Jean Valjean, “four paces will put life into my legs once ore.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.120#They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. On rriving before the closed gate and the porter’s pavilion Fauchelevent, who held he grave-digger’s card in his hand, dropped it into the box, the porter pulled he rope, the gate opened, and they went out.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.121#“How well everything is going!” said Fauchelevent; “what a capital idea hat was of yours, Father Madeleine!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.122#They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world. In he neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to two assports.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.123#The Rue Vaugirard was deserted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.124#“Father Madeleine,” said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raising his yes to the houses, “Your eyes are better than mine. Show me No. 87.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.125#“Here it is,” said Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.126#“There is no one in the street,” said Fauchelevent. “Give me your mattock nd wait a couple of minutes for me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.127#Fauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by the nstinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked in the dark, t the door of an attic.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.128#A voice replied: “Come in.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.129#It was Gribier’s voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.130#Fauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger’s dwelling was, like all uch wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret. A acking-case—a coffin, perhaps—took the place of a commode, a butter-pot served or a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served for a bed, the floor served nstead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on a tattered fragment which had been piece of an old carpet, a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a eap. The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been verturned. One would have said that there had been an earthquake “for one.” The overs were displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother had een crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorous and ll-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate earch for his card, and had made everybody in the garret, from the jug to his ife, responsible for its loss. He wore an air of desperation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.131#But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to ake any notice of this sad side of his success.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.132#He entered and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.133#“I have brought you back your shovel and pick.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.134#Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.136#“And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the emetery.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.137#And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.138#“What is the meaning of this?” demanded Gribier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.139#“The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket, hat I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried the orpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work, that the orter will return your card to you, and that you will not have to pay fifteen rancs.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.7.140#“Thanks, villager!” exclaimed Gribier, radiant. “The next time I will pay or the drinks.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.3#The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer’s in the Rue u Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day. osette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling silently and understanding othing. She trembled to such a degree that she wept. She had neither eaten nor lept. The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions, without btaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze. Cosette had etrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days. She ivined that they were passing through a crisis. She was deeply conscious that t was necessary to “be good.” Who has not experienced the sovereign power of hose two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified ittle being: _Say nothing! _ Fear is mute. Moreover, no one guards a secret ike a child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.4#But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, she eheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that any houghtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessed that it ssued from an abyss.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.5#Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All the doors pened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.6#Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how o get in.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.7#The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little servant’s oor which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which could still be een from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at the bottom of the court, hich faced the carriage entrance.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.9#The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother, with er veil lowered, stood beside her.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.40#The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to the ocal mother:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.41#“She will grow up ugly.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.42#The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the orner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.44#On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden, and he nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils. At he extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two men, Fauvent and another an, were visible as they dug side by side. An enormous event. Their silence was roken to the extent of saying to each other: “He is an assistant gardener.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.45#The vocal mothers added: “He is a brother of Father Fauvent.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.46#Jean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belled nee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.47#The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the rioress’s observation upon Cosette: “She will grow up ugly.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.48#The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy to osette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.49#There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.50#It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are onscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty do not asily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their ood looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty. Hence a ively taste for plain girls.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.51#The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old auchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whom he had aved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who said to himself: “He pared me that fine”; with the convent, which, being enabled, thanks to him, to etain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Cæsar and atisfied God. There was a coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a offin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been eeply disturbed thereby, but no one was aware of it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.8.52#As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great. auchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners. pon the occasion of the archbishop’s next visit, the prioress recounted the ffair to his Grace, making something of a confession at the same time, and yet oasting of her deed. On leaving the convent, the archbishop mentioned it with pproval, and in a whisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur’s confessor, afterwards rchbishop of Reims and Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became idespread, for it made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the hen reigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the uncio’s establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della enga; it contained these lines: “It appears that there is in a convent in Paris n excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent.” Nothing of this riumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went on grafting, weeding, and overing up his melon beds, without in the least suspecting his excellences and is sanctity. Neither did he suspect his glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey ull whose portrait is published in the _London Illustrated News_, with this nscription: “Bull which carried off the prize at the Cattle Show.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.1#Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.2#It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean’s aughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and then, she ould not have said anything in any case. As we have just observed, nothing rains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosette had suffered so much, that he feared everything, even to speak or to breathe. A single word had so often rought down an avalanche upon her. She had hardly begun to regain her onfidence since she had been with Jean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed o the convent. Only she regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, owever, she did say to Jean Valjean: “Father, if I had known, I would have rought her away with me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.3#Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don the arb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them to estore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the same mourning uit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the Thénardiers’ inn. It as not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean locked up these garments, plus he stockings and the shoes, with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in hich convents abound, in a little valise which he found means of procuring. He et this valise on a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his erson. “Father,” Cosette asked him one day, “what is there in that box which mells so good?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.4#Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, in ddition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knew nothing; in he first place it made him happy; next, he had much less work, since it was hared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he found the presence of M. adeleine an advantage, in that he used three times as much as he had done reviously, and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner, seeing that M. adeleine paid for it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.5#The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean _the ther Fauvent_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.6#If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert’s glance, they would ventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the ehalf of the garden, it was always the elder Fauchelevent, the old, the infirm, he lame man, who went, and never the other; but whether it is that eyes onstantly fixed on God know not how to spy, or whether they were, by reference, occupied in keeping watch on each other, they paid no heed to his.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.7#Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not stir ut. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.8#This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs. enceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of the sky here to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette enough to remain appy.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.10#He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company with auchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still in existence in 845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three chambers, all of which ere utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls. The principal one had been iven up, by force, for Jean Valjean had opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by ather Fauchelevent. The walls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to he two nails whereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note f ’93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the following s an exact facsimile:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.13#Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful. e had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly found himself a gardener nce more. It will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts or agriculture. He turned these to advantage. Almost all the trees in the rchard were ungrafted, and wild. He budded them and made them produce excellent ruit.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.14#Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the sisters ere melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and adored him. At he appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered the lowly cabin, she illed it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness ncrease with the happiness which he afforded Cosette. The joy which we inspire as this charming property, that, far from growing meagre, like all reflections, t returns to us more radiant than ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean atched her running and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh rom that of the rest.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.15#For Cosette laughed now.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.16#Cosette’s face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. The gloom ad disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it banishes winter rom the human countenance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.17#Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjean azed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look at the indows of her dormitory.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.18#God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette, to phold and complete the Bishop’s work in Jean Valjean. It is certain that virtue djoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil exists there. Jean aljean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably near that side and that ridge, when Providence cast his lot in the convent of the Petit-Picpus; so long s he had compared himself only to the Bishop, he had regarded himself as nworthy and had remained humble; but for some time past he had been comparing imself to men in general, and pride was beginning to spring up. Who knows? He ight have ended by returning very gradually to hatred.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.19#The convent stopped him on that downward path.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.20#This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth, in hat had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quite recently gain, he had beheld another,—a frightful place, a terrible place, whose everities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice, and the crime of he law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the cloister; and when he meditated how e had formed a part of the galleys, and that he now, so to speak, was a pectator of the cloister, he confronted the two in his own mind with nxiety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.21#Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly descended he endless spirals of reverie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.22#He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose at awn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they lay on amp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick, in rooms hich were heated only in the very harshest months of the year; they were lothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed, as a great favor, linen rousers in the hottest weather, and a woollen carter’s blouse on their backs hen it was very cold; they drank no wine, and ate no meat, except when they ent on “fatigue duty.” They lived nameless, designated only by numbers, and onverted, after a manner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with owered voices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:2.8.9.24#These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, with lowered oices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world, not with their backs ruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulders lacerated with their iscipline. Their names, also, had vanished from among men; they no longer xisted except under austere appellations. They never ate meat and they never rank wine; they often remained until evening without food; they were attired, ot in a red blouse, but in a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in ummer and thin in winter, without the power to add or subtract anything from t; without having even, according to the season, the resource of the linen arment or the woollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore serge hemises which gave them fever. They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only during igorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they slept, not on attresses two inches thick, but on straw. And finally, they were not even llowed their sleep; every night, after a day of toil, they were obliged, in the eariness of their first slumber, at the moment when they were falling sound sleep and beginning to get warm, to rouse themselves, to rise and to go and ray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel, with their knees on the stones.

He has his own ames, his own bits of mischief, whose foundation consists of hatred for the ourgeois; his peculiar metaphors: to be dead is _to eat dandelions by the oot_; his own occupations, calling hackney-coaches, letting down arriage-steps, establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street n heavy rains, which he calls _making the bridge of arts_, crying discourses ronounced by the authorities in favor of the French people, cleaning out the racks in the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed of all the ittle morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets. This urious money, which receives the name of _loques_—rags—has an invariable and ell-regulated currency in this little Bohemia of children.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.2.3#Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively in the corners; he lady-bird, the death’s-head plant-louse, the daddy-long-legs, “the devil,” a lack insect, which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns. He as his fabulous monster, which has scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, hich has pustules on its back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of ld lime-kilns and wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which rawls sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has a ook, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls this monster the deaf thing.” The search for these “deaf things” among the stones is a joy f formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a aving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice. Each region of Paris is elebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there. There are ar-wigs in the timber-yards of the Ursulines, there are millepeds in the antheon, there are tadpoles in the ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.

The campagna of Rome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is nother; to behold nothing but fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of ountry offers us, is to remain on the surface; all aspects of things are houghts of God.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.6.1#At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this book akes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at the corner of very street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss here); stray children bounded in Paris. The statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty omeless children picked up annually at that period, by the police patrols, in nenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction, and under the arches of he bridges. One of these nests, which has become famous, produced “the swallows f the bridge of Arcola.” This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social ymptoms. All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.6.2#Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative easure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the exception s just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man, while early everywhere the child left to itself is, in some sort, sacrificed and bandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him onesty and conscience, the street boy of Paris, we insist on this point, owever defaced and injured on the surface, is almost intact on the interior. It s a magnificent thing to put on record, and one which shines forth in the plendid probity of our popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility esults from the idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the ater of the ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.6.3#What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one xperiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one ancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family. In the ivilization of the present day, incomplete as it still is, it is not a very bnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into he darkness, not knowing clearly what has become of their children, and llowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway. Hence these obscure estinies. This is called, for this sad thing has given rise to an expression, to be cast on the pavements of Paris.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.6.4#Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was not iscouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in the lower egions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of the powerful. The atred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma. What is the se of “half-lights”? Such was the countersign. Now, the erring child is the orollary of the ignorant child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.6.5#Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in that ase it skimmed the streets.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.1.6.6#Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desired to reate a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us consider the means. There an be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that plaything of the winds, and or the purpose of towing it, in case of necessity, there is not the vessel hich goes where it pleases, either by means of oars or of steam; the galleys ere then to the marine what steamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were ecessary; but the galley is moved only by the galley-slave; hence, alley-slaves were required. Colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the arliaments make as many convicts as possible. The magistracy showed a great eal of complaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a rocession—it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A child was ncountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteen years of age and did ot know where he was to sleep, he was sent to the galleys. Grand reign; grand entury.

People whispered with terror monstrous onjectures as to the king’s baths of purple. Barbier speaks ingenuously of hese things. It sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard, when they ran hort of children, took those who had fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked he exempts. In that case, the parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? he exempts? No, the fathers.

In order not to lose anything of the affair, he scales the walls, he hoists imself to balconies, he ascends trees, he suspends himself to gratings, he lings fast to chimneys. The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner. A oof inspires him with no more fear than a mast. There is no festival which omes up to an execution on the Place de Grève. Samson and the Abbé Montès are he truly popular names. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They ometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die ravely, uttered these words which contain a future: “I was jealous of him.” In he brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine is. “Politicians” re confused with assassins in the same legend. They have a tradition as to verybody’s last garment. It is known that Tolleron had a fireman’s cap, Avril n otter cap, Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bareheaded, hat Castaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small eard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffé and his mother uarrelled. “Don’t reproach each other for your basket,” shouted a gamin to hem. Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, and being too mall in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it. A endarme stationed opposite frowned. “Let me climb up, m’sieu le gendarme,” said he gamin.

Nevertheless the police keep an eye on him, and the result is a highly ramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that ry which was celebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; t scans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the leusiac chant of the Panathenæa, and in it one encounters again the ancient vohe.

One summer vening, when Louis Philippe was returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, o higher than his knee, perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in harcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that ood-nature which came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the ear, and gave the child a louis, saying: “The pear is on that also."19 The amin loves uproar. A certain state of violence pleases him. He execrates “the urés.” One day, in the Rue de l’Université, one of these scamps was putting his humb to his nose at the carriage gate of No. 69. “Why are you doing that at the ate?” a passer-by asked.

He will tell you fluently and without flinching: “Such an one is a traitor_; such another is very _malicious_; such another is _great_; such nother is _ridiculous_.” (All these words: traitor, malicious, great, idiculous, have a particular meaning in his mouth.)

This silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared—for hose who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the ast—from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which, under ouis XIV., the names of all the provinces of France were appended exactly as in ur day, the streets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all he capitals of Europe; a progression, by the way, in which progress is isible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.1.2#M. Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, was one of hose men who had become curiosities to be viewed, simply because they have ived a long time, and who are strange because they formerly resembled verybody, and now resemble nobody. He was a peculiar old man, and in very ruth, a man of another age, the real, complete and rather haughty bourgeois of he eighteenth century, who wore his good, old bourgeoisie with the air with hich marquises wear their marquisates. He was over ninety years of age, his alk was erect, he talked loudly, saw clearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and nored. He had all thirty-two of his teeth. He only wore spectacles when he ead. He was of an amorous disposition, but declared that, for the last ten ears, he had wholly and decidedly renounced women. He could no longer please, e said; he did not add: “I am too old,” but: “I am too poor.” He said: “If I ere not ruined—Héée!” All he had left, in fact, was an income of about fifteen housand francs. His dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred housand livres income for mistresses. He did not belong, as the reader will erceive, to that puny variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have een dying all their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot; this jovial ld man had always had good health. He was superficial, rapid, easily angered. e flew into a passion at everything, generally quite contrary to all reason. hen contradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as he had done in the reat century. He had a daughter over fifty years of age, and unmarried, whom he hastised severely with his tongue, when in a rage, and whom he would have liked o whip. She seemed to him to be eight years old. He boxed his servants’ ears oundly, and said: “Ah! carogne!” One of his oaths was: “By the pantoufloche of he pantouflochade!” He had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himself haved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him, being ealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty and coquettish arberess. M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things, and eclared that he was extremely sagacious; here is one of his sayings: “I have, n truth, some penetration; I am able to say when a flea bites me, from what oman it came.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.1.3#The words which he uttered the most frequently were: _the sensible man_, nd _nature_. He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our poch has accorded to it, but he made it enter, after his own fashion, into his ittle chimney-corner satires: “Nature,” he said, “in order that civilization ay have a little of everything, gives it even specimens of its amusing arbarism. Europe possesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale. The at is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. The dancers at he opera are pink female savages. They do not eat men, they crunch them; or, agicians that they are, they transform them into oysters and swallow them. The aribbeans leave only the bones, they leave only the shell.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.2.1#He lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned the ouse. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the number has robably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of aris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor, etween street and gardens, furnished to the very ceilings with great Gobelins nd Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes; the subjects of the eilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the armchairs. He nveloped his bed in a vast, nine-leaved screen of Coromandel lacquer. Long, ull curtains hung from the windows, and formed great, broken folds that were ery magnificent. The garden situated immediately under his windows was attached o that one of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or ifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great gility. In addition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had a boudoir of hich he thought a great deal, a gallant and elegant retreat, with magnificent angings of straw, with a pattern of flowers and fleurs-de-lys made on the alleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne for his istress. M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt, who ad died a centenarian. He had had two wives. His manners were something between hose of the courtier, which he had never been, and the lawyer, which he might ave been. He was gay, and caressing when he had a mind. In his youth he had een one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their istresses, because they are, at the same time, the most sullen of husbands and he most charming of lovers in existence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He ad in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by ordaens, executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in confused and hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand’s attire was not the habit of ouis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyables of the irectory. He had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the ashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous revers, a long wallow-tail and large steel buttons. With this he wore knee-breeches and buckle hoes. He always thrust his hands into his fobs. He said authoritatively: “The rench Revolution is a heap of blackguards.”

He abounded in memories. He was accustomed to xclaim: “How pretty she was—that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last ime I saw her at Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her ome-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly arrived, and er little agitation muff!” He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of ain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking about effusively. “I was dressed like Turk of the Levant Levantin,” said he. Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by hance when he was twenty, had described him as “a charming fool.” He was orrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power, regarding them s vulgar and bourgeois. He read the journals, the _newspapers, the gazettes_ as e said, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. “Oh!” he said, “what people hese are! Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer! There’s a minister for you! I can magine this in a journal: ‘M. Gillenorman, minister!’ that would be a farce. ell! They are so stupid that it would pass”; he merrily called everything by ts name, whether decent or indecent, and did not restrain himself in the least efore ladies. He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain ranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with he unceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age of eriphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose.

Louis XV. sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope.” He would ave been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him hat the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M.

If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic in is presence, he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of wooning. He sometimes alluded to his ninety years, and said, “I hope that I hall not see ninety-three twice.” On these occasions, he hinted to people that e meant to live to be a hundred.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.5.1#He had theories. Here is one of them: “When a man is passionately fond of omen, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little, who is omely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the code, and ealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry nd of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife control the purse-strings. his abdication sets him free. Then his wife busies herself, grows passionately ond of handling coin, gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process, ndertakes the education of half-share tenants and the training of farmers, onvokes lawyers, presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of he law, follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself he sovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fast and nnuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges, disarranges, hoards, avishes; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight, and that consoles er. While her husband disdains her, she has the satisfaction of ruining her usband.” This theory M. Gillenormand had himself applied, and it had become his istory. His wife—the second one—had administered his fortune in such a manner hat, one fine day, when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained o him just sufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in an nnuity of fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire with im. He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave a property ehind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures, nd, for instance, become _national property_; he had been present at the vatars of consolidated three per cents, and he had no great faith in the Great ook of the Public Debt. “All that’s the Rue Quincampois!” he said. His house in he Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire belonged to him, as we have already stated. He ad two servants, “a male and a female.” When a servant entered his stablishment, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name f their province: Nîmois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, oundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running wenty paces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque_. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the agnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, a ordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. “How much wages do ou want a month?” asked M. Gillenormand. “Thirty francs.” “What is your name?” Olympie.” “You shall have fifty francs, and you shall be called Nicolette.”

One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal atisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that he had remained a risk spark, and that he passed energetically for such. This he called having royal renown.” This royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular indfalls. One day, there was brought to him in a basket, as though it had been basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who was yelling like the deuce, nd duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six onths previously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand had, at that time, fully ompleted his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in the establishment. nd whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that? What udacity! What an abominable calumny! M. Gillenormand himself was not at all nraged. He gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is lattered by the calumny, and said in an aside: “Well, what now? What’s the atter? You are finely taken aback, and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. e Duc d’Angoulême, the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade f fifteen when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d’Alluye, brother to he Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age of ighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Présidente Jacquin, a son, a real child f love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor of state; one of the reat men of this century, the Abbé Tabaraud, is the son of a man of ighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary in these things. And then, he Bible! Upon that I declare that this little gentleman is none of mine. Let im be taken care of. It is not his fault.” This manner of procedure was ood-tempered. The woman, whose name was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the ollowing year. It was a boy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He ent the two brats back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month or their maintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so any ore. He added: “I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well. I shall o to see them from time to time.” And this he did. He had had a brother who was priest, and who had been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and hirty years, and had died at seventy-nine. “I lost him young,” said he. This rother, of whom but little memory remains, was a peaceable miser, who, being a riest, thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met, but he ever gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a eans of going to hell by way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he ever haggled over his alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He was kindly, brupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mind would have been agnificent. He desired that all which concerned him should be done in a grand anner, even his rogueries. One day, having been cheated by a business man in a atter of inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner, he uttered this solemn xclamation: “That was indecently done! I am really ashamed of this pilfering. verything has degenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is ot the way to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed as though in a forest, but adly robbed. _Silvæ sint consule dignæ! _” He had had two wives, as we have lready mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, who had remained nmarried, and by the second another daughter, who had died at about the age of hirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance, or otherwise, a soldier of ortune who had served in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire, who had on the cross at Austerlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo. _“He is the isgrace of my family,” _ said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount of nuff, and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle ith the back of one hand. He believed very little in God.

He had only retired to the Marais when he uitted society, long after attaining the age of eighty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.7.4#And, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. The rincipal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his door absolutely losed during the day, and never to receive any one whatever except in the vening. He dined at five o’clock, and after that his door was open. That had een the fashion of his century, and he would not swerve from it. “The day is ulgar,” said he, “and deserves only a closed shutter. Fashionable people only ight up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars.” And he barricaded imself against every one, even had it been the king himself. This was the ntiquated elegance of his day.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.1#We have just spoken of M. Gillenormand’s two daughters. They had come into he world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very little resemblance o each other, either in character or countenance, and had also been as little ike sisters to each other as possible. The youngest had a charming soul, which urned towards all that belongs to the light, was occupied with flowers, with erses, with music, which fluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, thereal, and was wedded from her very youth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic igure. The elder had also her chimera; she espied in the azure some very ealthy purveyor, a contractor, a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man, r even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the antechamber ith a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues of the town-hall, to be Madame la Préfète,”—all this had created a whirlwind in her imagination. Thus he two sisters strayed, each in her own dream, at the epoch when they were oung girls. Both had wings, the one like an angel, the other like a goose.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.2#No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. No paradise ecomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of her dreams, but he died. The elder did not marry at all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.3#At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are elating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, with one of the harpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see. A haracteristic detail; outside of her immediate family, no one had ever known er first name. She was called _Mademoiselle Gillenormand, the elder_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.4#In the matter of _cant_, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given points o a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness. She herished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a man had beheld her arter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.5#Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe was ever sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. She multiplied lasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking. The peculiarity of rudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the ess menaced.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.6#Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence, he allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew, named Théodule, to mbrace her without displeasure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.7#In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: _Prude_, under which we have lassed her, suited her to absolute perfection. Mademoiselle Gillenormand was a ort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue and a demi-vice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.8#To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belonged to the ociety of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals, mumbled special risons, revered “the holy blood,” venerated “the sacred heart,” remained for ours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was naccessible to the rank and file of the faithful, and there allowed her soul to oar among little clouds of marble, and through great rays of gilded wood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.9#She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, named Mademoiselle aubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand ad the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyond the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, ademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways f making preserves. Mademoiselle Vaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine f stupidity without a single spot of intelligence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.10#Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than ost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She had never een malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wear away the ngles, and the softening which comes with time had come to her. She was elancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret. here breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished, and hich had never had a beginning.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.2.8.11#She kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter near him, s we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.head#CHAPTER I—AN ANCIENT SALON
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.1#When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented many ery good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M. Gillenormand as received in society. As he had a double measure of wit, in the first place, hat which was born with him, and secondly, that which was attributed to him, he as even sought out and made much of. He never went anywhere except on condition f being the chief person there. There are people who will have influence at any rice, and who will have other people busy themselves over them; when they annot be oracles, they turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this nature; his omination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect othing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened to him to hold his own gainst M. de Bonald, and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallée.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.2#About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his wn neighborhood, in the Rue Férou, with Madame la Baronne de T., a worthy and espectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of France to Berlin under ouis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his lifetime, had gone very passionately nto ecstasies and magnetic visions, had died bankrupt, during the emigration, eaving, as his entire fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his ub, in ten manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges. adame de T. had not published the memoirs, out of pride, and maintained herself n a meagre income which had survived no one knew how.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.3#Madame de T. lived far from the Court; “a very mixed society,” as she said, n a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembled twice a week about er widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely Royalist salon. They sipped ea there, and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century, the charter, he Bonapartists, the prostitution of the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of ouis XVIII., according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they poke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards harles X.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.4#The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called _Nicolas_, were eceived there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most delicate and charming omen in the world, went into ecstasies over couplets like the following, ddressed to “the federates”:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.6#There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible, with nnocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, with quatrains, ith distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, a moderate cabinet, of hich MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.8#Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, “an abominably Jacobin hamber,” and from this list they combined alliances of names, in such a manner s to form, for example, phrases like the following: _Damas. Sabran. ouvion-Saint-Cyr_.—All this was done merrily. In that society, they parodied he Revolution. They used I know not what desires to give point to the same rath in inverse sense. They sang their little _Ça ira: _—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.12#Like certain church towers, Madame de T.‘s salon had two cocks. One of hem was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, of whom it was hispered about, with a sort of respect: “Do you know? That is the Lamothe of he affair of the necklace.” These singular amnesties do occur in parties.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.13#Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decay hrough too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the same way hat there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold, there is diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons. The ancient ociety of the upper classes held themselves above this law, as above every ther. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour, had his entry with M. le Prince de oubise. In spite of? No, because. Du Barry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, as very welcome at the house of M. le Maréchal de Richelieu. This society is lympus. Mercury and the Prince de Guémenée are at home there. A thief is dmitted there, provided he be a god.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.14#The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years of ge, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air, his old and angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coat buttoned up to is cravat, and his long legs always crossed in long, flabby trousers of the hue f burnt sienna. His face was the same color as his trousers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.15#This M. de Lamothe was “held in consideration” in this salon on account of is “celebrity” and, strange to say, though true, because of his name of alois.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.16#As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-rate uality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering in any way ith his dignity, a certain manner about him which was imposing, dignified, onest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his great age added to it. One is ot a century with impunity. The years finally produce around a head a venerable ishevelment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.17#In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the ld rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored Louis XVIII., ame to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count de Ruppin, he was eceived by the descendant of Louis XIV. somewhat as though he had been the arquis de Brandebourg, and with the most delicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand pproved: “All kings who are not the King of France,” said he, “are provincial ings.” One day, the following question was put and the following answer eturned in his presence: “To what was the editor of the _Courrier Français_ ondemned?” “To be suspended.” “_Sus_ is superfluous,” observed M. illenormand.22 Remarks of this nature found a situation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.18#At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, he said, n seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: “There goes his Excellency the Evil ne.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.19#M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tall ademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsome little boy f seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trusting eyes, who never ppeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him: “How handsome e is! What a pity! Poor child!” This child was the one of whom we dropped a ord a while ago. He was called “poor child,” because he had for a father “a rigand of the Loire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.1.20#This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand’s son-in-law, who has lready been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called “the disgrace of his amily.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.head#CHAPTER II—ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.1#Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at this poch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge, which ill soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron cable bridge, might ave observed, had he dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years f age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, o which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with ooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly hite, a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, rematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of hose compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, and border the eft bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, charming enclosures full of lowers of which one could say, were they much larger: “these are gardens,” and ere they a little smaller: “these are bouquets.” All these enclosures abut upon he river at one end, and on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and he wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these nclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone nd solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young nor old, either homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. he plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the eauty of the flowers which he cultivated there. These flowers were his ccupation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.2#By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets of water, e had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he had invented certain ulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature. He was ngenious; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in the formation of little clumps f earth of heath mould, for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from merica and China. He was in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, lanting, cutting, hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of indness, sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful or hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of a child n a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of rass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was very plain, and he drank ore milk than wine. A child could make him give way, and his servant scolded im. He was so timid that he seemed shy, he rarely went out, and he saw no one ut the poor people who tapped at his pane and his curé, the Abbé Mabeuf, a good ld man. Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any hance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened is door with a smile. He was the “brigand of the Loire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.3#Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies, the Moniteur_, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been struck by a ame which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name of Georges Pontmercy. hen very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier in Saintonge’s egiment. The revolution broke out. Saintonge’s regiment formed a part of the rmy of the Rhine; for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names f provinces even after the fall of the monarchy, and were only divided into rigades in 1794. Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, t Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard’s earguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince f Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only rejoined the main body f the army when the enemy’s cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the arapet to the foot of the glacis. He was under Kléber at Marchiennes and at the attle of Mont-Palissel, where a ball from a biscaïen broke his arm. Then he assed to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who efended the Col de Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its djutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier’s side n the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to ay: “Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier.” He beheld his old eneral, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with uplifted sabre, he was houting: “Forward!” Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of he campaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure ort on the coast, he fell into a wasps’-nest of seven or eight English vessels. he Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the oldiers between decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel. ontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past under the uns of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having ncreased, he attacked with his pinnace, and captured a large English transport hich was carrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men and orses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. In 1805 he was in that alher division which took Günzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he eceived into his arms, beneath a storm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally ounded at the head of the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz n that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy’s fire. When the avalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the ine, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the Guard. he Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua, Mélas, and lexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession. He formed a part of the ighth corps of the grand army which Mortier commanded, and which captured amburg. Then he was transferred to the 55th of the line, which was the old egiment of Flanders. At Eylau he was in the cemetery where, for the space of wo hours, the heroic Captain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, ustained alone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile rmy. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery. He as at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Bérésina, then Lutzen, Bautzen, resden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail, hâteau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the edoubtable position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten ossacks to the sword, and saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well lashed up on this occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his eft arm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just xchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was called under he old regime, _the double hand_, that is to say, an equal aptitude for andling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a squadron or a battalion as n officer. It is from this aptitude, perfected by a military education, which ertain special branches of the service arise, the dragoons, for example, who re both cavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied apoleon to the Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of uirassiers, in Dubois’ brigade. It was he who captured the standard of the unenburg battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor’s feet. He was overed with blood. While tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut cross his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him: “You are a olonel, you are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion of Honor!” Pontmercy eplied: “Sire, I thank you for my widow.” An hour later, he fell in the ravine f Ohain. Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same “brigand of the oire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.4#We have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo, Pontmercy, ho had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it will be remembered, ad succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged himself from ambulance to mbulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.5#The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him into esidence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King Louis XVIII., egarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred Days as not having ccurred at all, did not recognize his quality as an officer of the Legion of onor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title of baron. He, on his side, eglected no occasion of signing himself “Colonel Baron Pontmercy.” He had only n old blue coat, and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as n officer of the Legion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned hat the authorities would prosecute him for “illegal” wearing of this ecoration. When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious ntermediary, Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile: “I do not know whether I o longer understand French, or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is hat I do not understand.” Then he went out for eight successive days with his osette. They dared not interfere with him. Two or three times the Minister of ar and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following ddress: _“A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy.” _ He sent back the letters with he seals unbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in he same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to _General onaparte_. Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by having in is mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.8#He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He had hired he smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there alone, we have ust seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he had found time to marry ademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois, thoroughly indignant at bottom, ad given his consent with a sigh, saying: “The greatest families are forced nto it.” In 1815, Madame Pontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the ay, lofty in sentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, leaving a hild. This child had been the colonel’s joy in his solitude; but the randfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that if the child ere not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had yielded in the ittle one’s interest, and had transferred his love to flowers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.9#Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief nor onspired.

They ntended to bring up the child in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong o accept these conditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing ight and sacrificing no one but himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.2.11#The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but the nheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable.

No one opened his mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, n the society into which his grandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and inks, had eventually enlightened the little boy’s mind; he had finally nderstood something of the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and pinions which were, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration nd slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only with shame nd with a pain at his heart.

There, trembling lest the aunt should turn round, oncealed behind a pillar, motionless, not daring to breathe, he gazed at his hild. The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster.

That man, who had so manly an air, yet who was weeping ike a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clung to his mind. One day, aving gone to Vernon to see his brother, he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy n the bridge, and had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had entioned the circumstance to the curé, and both had paid the colonel a visit, n some pretext or other. This visit led to others. The colonel, who had been xtremely reserved at first, ended by opening his heart, and the curé and the arden finally came to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing is happiness to his child’s future. This caused the curé to regard him with eneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fond of the uré. And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so penetrate each ther, and so amalgamate with each other, as an old priest and an old soldier. t bottom, the man is the same. The one has devoted his life to his country here elow, the other to his country on high; that is the only difference.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.1#Madame de T.‘s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. It as the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. This opening as sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than day, came to him through his skylight. This child, who had been all joy and light on entering this trange world, soon became melancholy, and, what is still more contrary to his ge, grave. Surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages, he gazed bout him with serious amazement. Everything conspired to increase this stonishment in him. There were in Madame de T.‘s salon some very noble ladies amed Mathan, Noé, Lévis,—which was pronounced Lévi,—Cambis, pronounced Cambyse. hese antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child’s mind with he Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when they were all there, eated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with reen, with their severe profiles, their gray or white hair, their long gowns of nother age, whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished, dropping, at are intervals, words which were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared t them with frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but atriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.2#With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of this ncient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private secretary to adame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published, under the pseudonym of Charles-Antoine_, monorhymed odes, the Prince de Beauff*******, who, though ery young, had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked oilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the arquis de C***** d’E******, the man in all France who best understood proportioned politeness,” the Comte d’Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable hin, and the Chévalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, alled the King’s cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, as wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the alleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, lso refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of a soldier. his was at Toulon. Their business was to go at night and gather up on the caffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the ay; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red alley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which was dry n the morning and wet at night. These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.‘s alon, and by dint of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies f the undiscoverable variety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard, . Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M. ornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches and his thin egs, sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been . le Comte d’Artois’ companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle crouching nder Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, and in that way he ad exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff. As for the riests, there was the Abbé Halma, the same to whom M. Larose, his collaborator n _la Foudre_, said: “Bah! Who is there who is not fifty years old? a few reenhorns perhaps?” The Abbé Letourneur, preacher to the King, the Abbé rayssinous, who was not, as yet, either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, nd who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing, and the Abbé Keravenant, uré of Saint-Germain-des-Prés; also the Pope’s Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi, rchbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long, pensive nose, nd another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of he seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See, Canon of the illustrious iberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, _Postulatore dei Santi_, which refers o matters of canonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the ection of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl****** *******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have, a few ears later, the honor of signing in the _Conservateur_ articles side by side ith Chateaubriand; M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishop of Toul****, and ften made trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was inister of Marine and War. The Cardinal of Cl****** T******* was a merry little an, who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his pecialty was a hatred of the Encyclopædia, and his desperate play at billiards, nd persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer venings, where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to he shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his onclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop _in partibus_ of Caryste: “Mark, Abbé, I ake a cannon.” The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had been brought to Madame de .‘s by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and ne of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his ssiduity at the Academy; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the ibrary where the French Academy then held its meetings, the curious could, on very Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, reshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door, apparently or the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar. All these cclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to he gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five eers of France, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de erb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc de al********, although Prince de Mon***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, ad so high an idea of France and its peerage, that he viewed everything through heir medium. It was he who said: “The Cardinals are the peers of France of ome; the lords are the peers of France of England.” Moreover, as it is ndispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century, this eudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand eigned there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.3#There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society. There eputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine. There is always trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he entered there, would have roduced the effect of Père Duchêne. Some of the scoffed-at did, nevertheless, enetrate thither on sufferance. Comte Beug*** was received there, subject to orrection.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.4#The “noble” salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons. The aubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists of to-day are emagogues, let us record it to their credit.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.5#At Madame de T.‘s the society was superior, taste was exquisite and aughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners there admitted f all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old régime itself, buried ut still alive. Some of these habits, especially in the matter of language, eem eccentric. Persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken or provincial that which was only antique. A woman was called _Madame la énérale. Madame la Colonelle_ was not entirely disused. The charming Madame de éon, in memory, no doubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse, referred this appellation to her title of Princesse. The Marquise de Créquy was lso called _Madame la Colonelle_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.6#It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the efinement of speaking to the King in private as _the King_, in the third erson, and never as _Your Majesty_, the designation of _Your Majesty_ having een “soiled by the usurper.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.7#Men and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age, which eleased them from the necessity of understanding it. They abetted each other in mazement. They communicated to each other that modicum of light which they ossessed. Methuselah bestowed information on Epimenides. The deaf man made the lind man acquainted with the course of things. They declared that the time hich had elapsed since Coblentz had not existed. In the same manner that Louis VIII. was by the grace of God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the migrants were, by rights, in the five and twentieth year of their dolescence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.8#All was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amounted to a reath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a papyrus.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.9#They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of obstinately esisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted of _Conserver, onservation, Conservateur; to be in good odor_,—that was the point. There are, n fact, aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups, and their ideas melled of it. It was a mummified society. The masters were embalmed, the ervants were stuffed with straw.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.13#To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of he throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat the thing hich one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is to cavil at the agot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics; it is to eproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry; it is to insult through xcess of respect; it is to discover that the Pope is not sufficiently papish, hat the King is not sufficiently royal, and that the night has too much light; t is to be discontented with alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily n the name of whiteness; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of ecoming their enemy; it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.

These six years were an extraordinary moment; at one and the same ime brilliant and gloomy, smiling and sombre, illuminated as by the radiance of awn and entirely covered, at the same time, with the shadows of the great atastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the ast. There existed in that light and that shadow, a complete little new and old orld, comic and sad, juvenile and senile, which was rubbing its eyes; nothing esembles an awakening like a return; a group which regarded France with ll-temper, and which France regarded with irony; good old owls of marquises by he streetful, who had returned, and of ghosts, the “former” subjects of mazement at everything, brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in France ut wept also, delighted to behold their country once more, in despair at not inding their monarchy; the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of he Empire, that is to say, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic aces who had lost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of harlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have just emarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and nothing ut a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and was only a sabre. ormer days did not recognize Yesterday. People no longer had the feeling for hat was grand. There was some one who called Bonaparte Scapin. This Society no onger exists. Nothing of it, we repeat, exists to-day. When we select from it ome one figure at random, and attempt to make it live again in thought, it eems as strange to us as the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as matter of fact, has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared beneath two evolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly they cover all that it is their ission to destroy and to bury, and how promptly they create frightful ulfs!

Later on the introduction into history of M. le Marquis de onaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King’s armies, was a concession to the pirit of the age.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.3.18#These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818, octrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way was to e Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the ultras were very roud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They had wit; they had silence; heir political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance; they should have ucceeded. They indulged, and usefully too, in excesses in the matter of white eckties and tightly buttoned coats. The mistake or the misfortune of the octrinarian party was to create aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. hey dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive rinciple. They opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative iberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say: “Thanks or Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has brought back radition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving, evoted. It has mingled, though with regret, the secular grandeurs of the onarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation. Its mistake is not to understand he Revolution, the Empire, glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the ge. But this mistake which it makes with regard to us,—have we not sometimes een guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought to be ntelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction of iberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France is wanting n respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards its mother, that is o say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, the nobility of the monarchy s treated as the nobility of the Empire was treated after the 5th of July. They ere unjust to the eagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we ust always have something to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the rown of Louis XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. de aublanc for erasing the N’s from the bridge of Jena! What was it that he did? hat are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lys re ours as well as the N’s. That is our patrimony. To what purpose shall we iminish it? We must not deny our country in the past any more than in the resent. Why not accept the whole of history? Why not love the whole of rance?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.1#Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday, hen he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the Virgin hither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself behind a illar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion, and nelt down, without paying any special heed, upon a chair of Utrecht velvet, on he back of which was inscribed this name: _Monsieur Mabeuf, warden_. Mass had ardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to Marius:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.2#“This is my place, sir.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.3#Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of his hair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.4#The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant; he old man approached him again and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.5#“I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and for gain disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me intrusive, and I ill explain myself.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.6#“There is no need of that, Sir,” said Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.7#“Yes!” went on the old man, “I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me. ou see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass is better rom here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that I have watched a oor, brave father come regularly, every two or three months, for the last ten ears, since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child, ecause he was prevented by family arrangements. He came at the hour when he new that his son would be brought to mass. The little one never suspected that is father was there. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor nnocent! The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be seen. He azed at his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow, poor man! I could ee that. This spot has become sanctified in my sight, and I have contracted a abit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer it to the stall to which have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knew that unhappy gentleman a ittle, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don’t know xactly what all, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw im. He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some ay. He was separated from him because of political opinions. Certainly, I pprove of political opinions, but there are people who do not know where to top. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a father is ot separated from his child for such a reason as that. He was one of onaparte’s colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where I have a rother who is a curé, and his name was something like Pontmarie or Montpercy. e had a fine sword-cut, on my honor.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.8#“Pontmercy,” suggested Marius, turning pale.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.9#“Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.10#“Sir,” said Marius, “he was my father.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.5.13#Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his odgings.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.1#Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.2#Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went straight o the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the _Moniteur_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.3#He read the _Moniteur_, he read all the histories of the Republic and the mpire, the _Memorial de Sainte-Hélène_, all the memoirs, all the newspapers, he bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything. The first time that he ame across his father’s name in the bulletins of the grand army, he had a fever or a week. He went to see the generals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, mong others, Comte H. Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him bout the life at Vernon, the colonel’s retreat, his flowers, his solitude. arius came to a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man, that pecies of lion-lamb who had been his father.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.4#In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his oments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands at all. He made is appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and he was not to be found. ather Gillenormand smiled. “Bah! bah! He is just of the age for the girls!” ometimes the old man added: “The deuce! I thought it was only an affair of allantry. It seems that it is an affair of passion!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.5#It was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring his ather.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.6#At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The phases f this change were numerous and successive. As this is the history of many inds of our day, we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by tep and to indicate them all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.7#That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.8#The first effect was to dazzle him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.9#Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only monstrous ords. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire, a sword in the ight. He had just taken a look at it, and where he had expected to find only a haos of shadows, he had beheld, with a sort of unprecedented surprise, mingled ith fear and joy, stars sparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, obespierre, Camille, Desmoulins, Danton, and a sun arise, Napoleon. He did not now where he stood. He recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by ittle, when his astonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this adiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined these ersonages without terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves uminously, in perspective, before his mind’s eye; he beheld each of these roups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: the Republic in he sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses, the Empire in the overeignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of he people emerge from the Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring orth from the Empire. He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been ood. What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too synthetic stimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here. It is the state of a ind on the march that we are recording. Progress is not accomplished in one tage. That stated, once for all, in connection with what precedes as well as ith what is to follow, we continue.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.10#He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his country o more than he had comprehended his father. He had not known either the one or he other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes. Now he saw, and n the one hand he admired, while on the other he adored.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.11#He was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair that ll he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if his father had till been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, in his compassion and is goodness, had permitted his father to be still among the living, how he ould have run, how he would have precipitated himself, how he would have cried o his father: “Father! Here I am! It is I! I have the same heart as thou! I am hy son!” How he would have embraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, azed upon his scar, pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! hy had his father died so early, before his time, before the justice, the love f his son had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his heart, which said o him every moment: “Alas!” At the same time, he became more truly serious, ore truly grave, more sure of his thought and his faith. At each instant, leams of the true came to complete his reason. An inward growth seemed to be in rogress within him. He was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement, which ave him two things that were new to him—his father and his country.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.12#As everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself that hich he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred; henceforth he lainly perceived the providential, divine and human sense of the great things hich he had been taught to detest, and of the great men whom he had been nstructed to curse. When he reflected on his former opinions, which were but hose of yesterday, and which, nevertheless, seemed to him already so very ncient, he grew indignant, yet he smiled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.13#From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to the ehabilitation of Napoleon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.14#But the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.15#From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of 814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all its nterests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. It execrated him even ore than it did Robespierre. It had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good ccount the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred of mothers. Bonaparte had ecome an almost fabulous monster, and in order to paint him to the imagination f the people, which, as we lately pointed out, resembles the imagination of hildren, the party of 1814 made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks n succession, from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that hich is terrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in peaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter, provided hat hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never entertained—about _that man_, as e was called—any other ideas in his mind. They had combined with the tenacity hich existed in his nature. There was in him a headstrong little man who hated apoleon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.16#On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents and aterials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes of Marius as gradually rent. He caught a glimpse of something immense, and he suspected hat he had been deceived up to that moment, on the score of Bonaparte as about ll the rest; each day he saw more distinctly; and he set about mounting, lowly, step by step, almost regretfully in the beginning, then with ntoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination, first the ombre steps, then the vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and plendid steps of enthusiasm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.17#One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candle as burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table close to the pen window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and mingled with his houghts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dull sounds, without knowing hence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, which is twelve hundred times larger han the earth, glowing like a firebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; t is formidable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.18#He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophes enned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld his father’s name, lways the name of the Emperor; the whole of that great Empire presented itself o him; he felt a flood swelling and rising within him; it seemed to him at oments that his father passed close to him like a breath, and whispered in his ar; he gradually got into a singular state; he thought that he heard drums, annon, trumpets, the measured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop f the cavalry; from time to time, his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazed pon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of pace, then they fell upon his book once more, and there they beheld other olossal things moving confusedly. His heart contracted within him. He was in a ransport, trembling, panting. All at once, without himself knowing what was in im, and what impulse he was obeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms ut of the window, gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite arkness, the eternal immensity, and exclaimed: “Long live the Emperor!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.19#From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,—the surper,—the tyrant,—the monster who was the lover of his own sisters,—the actor ho took lessons of Talma,—the poisoner of Jaffa,—the tiger,—Buonaparte,—all his vanished, and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in hich shone, at an inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Cæsar. The mperor had been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, or whom one sacrifices one’s self; he was something more to Marius. He was the redestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman group in the omination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect, of a destruction, the ontinuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry IV., of Richelieu, of Louis IV., and of the Committee of Public Safety, having his spots, no doubt, his aults, his crimes even, being a man, that is to say; but august in his faults, rilliant in his spots, powerful in his crime.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.20#He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: “The great ation!” He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of France, onquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world by the light hich he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always ise upon the frontier, and which will guard the future. Despot but dictator; a espot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution. Napoleon became or him the man-people as Jesus Christ is the man-God.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.21#It will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, his onversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went oo far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downward slope, it was lmost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticism for the sword took ossession of him, and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea. He id not perceive that, along with genius, and pell-mell, he was admitting force, hat is to say, that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry, on he one hand that which is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many espects, he had set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. here is a way of encountering error while on one’s way to the truth. He had a iolent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. In the new path hich he had entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime, as in easuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating circumstances.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.22#At all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerly eheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. His rientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He had turned quarely round.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.23#All these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his family btaining an inkling of the case.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.24#When, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old Bourbon nd ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite and the oyalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, profoundly democratic nd republican, he went to an engraver on the Quai des Orfévres and ordered a undred cards bearing this name: _Le Baron Marius Pontmercy_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.25#This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had aken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated round his ather.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.26#Only, as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any orter, he put them in his pocket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.27#By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to his ather, to the latter’s memory, and to the things for which the colonel had ought five and twenty years before, he receded from his grandfather. We have ong ago said, that M. Gillenormand’s temper did not please him. There already xisted between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the rivolous old man. The gayety of Géronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy f Werther. So long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been ommon to them both, Marius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When he bridge fell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above all, Marius xperienced unutterable impulses to revolt, when he reflected that it was M. illenormand who had, from stupid motives, torn him ruthlessly from the colonel, hus depriving the father of the child, and the child of the father.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.28#By dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion for is grandfather.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.29#Nothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we have lready said. Only he grew colder and colder; laconic at meals, and rare in the ouse. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle and alleged his tudies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a pretext. His grandfather ever departed from his infallible diagnosis: “In love! I know all about t.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.30#From time to time Marius absented himself.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.6.32#On one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went to ontfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him, and e sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeper Thénardier.

Gillenormand, on the paternal side, who ed a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic hearth. ieutenant Théodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make hat is called a fine officer. He had “a lady’s waist,” a victorious manner of railing his sword and of twirling his moustache in a hook. He visited Paris ery rarely, and so rarely that Marius had never seen him. The cousins knew each ther only by name. We think we have said that Théodule was the favorite of Aunt illenormand, who preferred him because she did not see him. Not seeing people ermits one to attribute to them all possible perfections.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.7.3#One morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment s much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing. Marius had just sked his grandfather’s permission to take a little trip, adding that he meant o set out that very evening. “Go!” had been his grandfather’s reply, and M. illenormand had added in an aside, as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his orehead: “Here he is passing the night out again.” Mademoiselle Gillenormand ad ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled, and on the staircase had dropped his exclamation: “This is too much!”—and this interrogation: “But where is it hat he goes?” She espied some adventure of the heart, more or less illicit, a oman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would not have been sorry o thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a mystery resembles getting he first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls do not detest this. There is some uriosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.7.5#In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond er wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping, with one ayer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of the Empire and the estoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels. The work was clumsy, the orker cross. She had been seated at this for several hours when the door pened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.1#It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting imself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time that M. illenormand had said: “He is sleeping out.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.2#Lieutenant Théodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this nexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular and isagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which was omposed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the colonel. He etreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and there was discipline in his retreat. Death appeared to him with large epaulets, and he almost made the ilitary salute to him. Not knowing what to write to his aunt, he decided not to rite at all; and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the iscovery made by Théodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of those ysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene at Vernon had ot had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.3#Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the morning, escended at his grandfather’s door, and, wearied by the two nights spent in the iligence, and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the wimming-school, he mounted rapidly to his chamber, took merely time enough to hrow off his travelling-coat, and the black ribbon which he wore round his eck, and went off to the bath.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.4#M. Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health, had eard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as his old legs ermitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived, in order to embrace im, and to question him while so doing, and to find out where he had been.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.5#But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to scend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was no longer here.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.6#The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but not efiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.8#And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, where Mademoiselle illenormand was already seated, busily embroidering her cart-wheels.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.9#The entrance was a triumphant one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.10#M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other the eck-ribbon, and exclaimed:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.23#“It is the slasher’s handwriting.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.24#The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then put t back in its case.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.25#At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fell rom one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormand picked it p and unfolded the blue paper.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.29#A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the old pinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and were hinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all probability.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.30#At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:—“A pretty state of hings!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.31#A few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. Even before e had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one of his own ards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter exclaimed with his ir of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.32#“Well! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you my ompliments. What is the meaning of this?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.33#Marius reddened slightly and replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.34#“It means that I am the son of my father.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.35#M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.36#“I am your father.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.37#“My father,” retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, “was a umble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously, who was reat in the greatest history that men have ever made, who lived in the bivouac or a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and bullets, in snow and mud by ay, beneath rain at night, who captured two flags, who received twenty wounds, ho died forgotten and abandoned, and who never committed but one mistake, which as to love too fondly two ingrates, his country and myself.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.38#This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word republic_, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his feet. Every ord that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old Royalist the ffect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand. From a dull hue he ad turned red, from red, purple, and from purple, flame-colored.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.39#“Marius!” he cried. “Abominable child! I do not know what your father was! do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not know him! But hat I do know is, that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men! hey were all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves! I say all! I say all! I now not one! I say all! Do you hear me, Marius! See here, you are no more a aron than my slipper is! They were all bandits in the service of Robespierre! ll who served B-u-o-naparté were brigands! They were all traitors who betrayed, etrayed, betrayed their legitimate king! All cowards who fled before the russians and the English at Waterloo! That is what I do know! Whether Monsieur our father comes in that category, I do not know! I am sorry for it, so much he worse, your humble servant!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.40#In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand who as the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know what would appen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who beholds all his sacred afers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds a passer-by spit upon his idol. t could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence. What was he o do? His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his resence, but by whom? By his grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without utraging the other? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it as equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the one hand as a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.41#He stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated, with ll this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised his eyes, gazed ixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of thunder:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.44#The old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. He wheeled ound towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on the chimney-piece, nd made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar majesty. Then he paced twice, lowly and in silence, from the fireplace to the window and from the window to he fireplace, traversing the whole length of the room, and making the polished loor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.45#On his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching this ncounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to her with a mile that was almost calm: “A baron like this gentleman, and a bourgeois like yself cannot remain under the same roof.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.46#And drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, with his row rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he extended his arm owards Marius and shouted to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.47#“Be off!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.48#Marius left the house.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.49#On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.51#Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowing hat to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as _you_ instead of thou_ for the next three months.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.52#Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was one ircumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation. There are lways petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas. They ugment the grievances in such cases, although, in reality, the wrongs are not ncreased by them. While carrying Marius’ “duds” precipitately to his chamber, t his grandfather’s command, Nicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, n the attic staircase, which was dark, that medallion of black shagreen which ontained the paper penned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could fterwards be found. Marius was convinced that “Monsieur Gillenormand”—from that ay forth he never alluded to him otherwise—had flung “his father’s testament” n the fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written, and, onsequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, that sacred elic,—all that was his very heart. What had been done with it?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.3.8.53#Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, and ithout knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes in a and-bag.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.1#At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certain evolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started forth from he depths of ’89 and ’93 were in the air. Youth was on the point, may the eader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were undergoing a transformation, lmost without being conscious of it, through the movement of the age. The eedle which moves round the compass also moves in souls. Each person was taking hat step in advance which he was bound to take. The Royalists were becoming iberals, liberals were turning democrats. It was a flood tide complicated with thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures; ence the combination of very singular ideas; people adored both Napoleon and iberty. We are making history here. These were the mirages of that period. pinions traverse phases. Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no less ingular sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.2#Other groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, they sounded rinciples, they attached themselves to the right. They grew enthusiastic for he absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite realizations; the absolute, by ts very rigidity, urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in llimitable space. There is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams. And here is nothing like dreams for engendering the future. Utopia to-day, flesh nd blood to-morrow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.3#These advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning of mystery enaced “the established order of things,” which was suspicious and underhand. A ign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. The second thoughts of power eet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine. The incubation of nsurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of _coups d‘état_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.4#There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying rganizations, like the German _tugendbund_ and Italian Carbonarism; but here nd there there were dark underminings, which were in process of throwing off hoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there existed at Paris, among ther affiliations of that nature, the society of the Friends of the A B C.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.5#What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its object pparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.6#They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,—the _Abaissé_,—the ebased,—that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people. It was a un which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes serious factors in olitics; witness the _Castratus ad castra_, which made a general of the army of arses; witness: _Barbari et Barberini_; witness: _Tu es Petrus et super hanc etram_, etc., etc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.7#The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in the tate of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended in heroes. hey assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market, in a wine-shop alled _Corinthe_, of which more will be heard later on, and near the Pantheon n a little café in the Rue Saint-Michel called the _Café Musain_, now torn own; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman, the second o the students.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.8#The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back room f the Café Musain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.9#This hall, which was tolerably remote from the café, with which it was onnected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exit with a rivate stairway on the little Rue des Grès. There they smoked and drank, and ambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loud tones about everything, nd in whispers of other things. An old map of France under the Republic was ailed to the wall,—a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police gent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.10#The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were on ordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of the principal nes. They belong, in a certain measure, to history: Enjolras, Combeferre, Jean rouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle or Laigle, Joly, Grantaire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.11#These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship. ll, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.12#This was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths which lie ehind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it will not erhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads, before he reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.13#Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,—the reader shall see hy later on,—was an only son and wealthy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.14#Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. He as angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would have said, to see he pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already, in some previous tate of existence, traversed the revolutionary apocalypse. He possessed the radition of it as though he had been a witness. He was acquainted with all the inute details of the great affair. A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular hing in a youth. He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the mmediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary ovement, the priest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, is lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty. A reat deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view. Like ertain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last, who ecame illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and was s rosy as a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor. Already a man, he till seemed a child. His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he as serious, it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing alled woman. He had but one passion—the right; but one thought—to overthrow the bstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, he ould have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored spring, he did ot hear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved im no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought lowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword. He was severe in his njoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the epublic. He was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired, nd had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. oe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any risette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that ace of a youth escaped from college, that page’s mien, those long, golden ashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the wind, those rosy cheeks, hose fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had conceived an appetite for that omplete aurora, and had tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and errible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught er not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of eaumarchais.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.15#By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution, ombeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the Revolution and ts philosophy there exists this difference—that its logic may end in war, hereas its philosophy can end only in peace. Combeferre complemented and ectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but broader. He desired to pour into all inds the extensive principles of general ideas: he said: “Revolution, but ivilization”; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the lue sky. The Revolution was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than ith Enjolras. Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural ight. The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself to ondorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did njolras. If it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history, he one would have been the just, the other the wise man. Enjolras was the more irile, Combeferre the more humane. _Homo_ and _vir_, that was the exact effect f their different shades. Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, hrough natural whiteness. He loved the word _citizen_, but he preferred the ord _man_. He would gladly have said: _Hombre_, like the Spanish. He read verything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of public lecturers, earned the polarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic over a lesson in hich Geoffroy Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of the external arotid artery, and the internal, the one which makes the face, and the one hich makes the brain; he kept up with what was going on, followed science step y step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the ebble which he found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth, ointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puységur nd Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even hosts; turned over the files of the _Moniteur_, reflected. He declared that the uture lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, and busied himself with educational uestions. He desired that society should labor without relaxation at the levation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting deas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, and he eared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from a literary point f view confined to two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical ogmatism of official pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end by onverting our colleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, xact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, houghtful “even to chimæras,” so his friends said. He believed in all dreams, ailroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, the fixing of mages in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, the steering of balloons. oreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind n every direction, by superstition, despotism, and prejudice. He was one of hose who think that science will eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a hief, Combeferre was a guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and o march behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of ighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and to ttack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better to bring the uman race into accord with its destiny gradually, by means of education, the nculcation of axioms, the promulgation of positive laws; and, between two ights, his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration. A onflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn? A olcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination. ossibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of he sublime. A light troubled by smoke, progress purchased at the expense of iolence, only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit. The headlong recipitation of a people into the truth, a ‘93, terrified him; nevertheless, tagnation was still more repulsive to him, in it he detected putrefaction and eath; on the whole, he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent o the cesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, e desired neither halt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by he absolute, adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre as inclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; he may have een cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable; phlegmatic, but mperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the uture to arrive in all its candor, and that nothing might disturb the immense nd virtuous evolution of the races. _The good must be innocent_, he repeated ncessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consists in keeping he dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart the ightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty of progress lies in eing spotless; and there exists between Washington, who represents the one, and anton, who incarnates the other, that difference which separates the swan from he angel with the wings of an eagle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.16#Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name was ehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and rofound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the Middle Ages. ean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, played on the flute, ade verses, loved the people, pitied woman, wept over the child, confounded God nd the future in the same confidence, and blamed the Revolution for having aused the fall of a royal head, that of André Chénier. His voice was ordinarily elicate, but suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, and almost n Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to those who now how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter of poetry, he referred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and these erved him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante, Juvenal, Æschylus, and saiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to Racine, and Agrippa d’Aubigné to orneille. He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and usied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events. His mind had two ttitudes, one on the side towards man, the other on that towards God; he tudied or he contemplated. All day long, he buried himself in social questions, alary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought, education, enal servitude, poverty, association, property, production and sharing, the nigma of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill with darkness; and at ight, he gazed upon the planets, those enormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was ealthy and an only son. He spoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, miled with embarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere othing, and was very timid. Yet he was intrepid.

He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; he called his also, delivering himself. He had taught himself to read and write; verything that he knew, he had learned by himself. Feuilly had a generous eart. The range of his embrace was immense. This orphan had adopted the eoples. As his mother had failed him, he meditated on his country. He brooded ith the profound divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the idea of the nationality_, had learned history with the express object of raging ith full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians, occupied hiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had for his specialty reece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, ppropriately and inappropriately, with the tenacity of right. The violations of urkey on Greece and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, nraged him. Above all things, the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is o more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with hat eloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the ubject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and that hree-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern of all hose horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time, have struck many noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of birth, so to speak. All ontemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland. The artition of Poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the orollaries. There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century ack, who has not signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, _ne variatur_, he partition of Poland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that as the first thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted hat crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815 was the eath of the game. Such was Feuilly’s habitual text. This poor workingman had onstituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she recompensed him by rendering im great. The fact is, that there is eternity in right. Warsaw can no more be artar than Venice can be Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the ttempt to make them so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the urface and reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. he protest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a nation annot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality have no uture. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief.

This sceptic’s name was rantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus: R. rantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything. Moreover, he as one of the students who had learned the most during their course at Paris; e knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Café Lemblin, and the best illiards at the Café Voltaire, that good cakes and lasses were to be found at he Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother auget’s, excellent matelotes at the Barrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin hite wine at the Barrière du Compat. He knew the best place for everything; in ddition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough ingle-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately omely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged with his omeliness, pronounced sentence on him as follows: “Grantaire is impossible”; ut Grantaire’s fatuity was not to be disconcerted.

Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence, had not left him single whole idea. He lived with irony. This was his axiom: “There is but one ertainty, my full glass.” He sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father s well as the brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. “They are reatly in advance to be dead,” he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: “There is gibbet which has been a success.” A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often runk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly: “J’aimons les illes, et j’aimons le bon vin.” Air: Vive Henri IV.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.1.47#However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a ogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire dmired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this anarchical scoffer nite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To the most absolute. In what anner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his ideas? No. By his character. A henomenon which is often observable. A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as imple as the law of complementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No ne loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The oad always has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in its light. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. e had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid ature charmed him, without his being clearly aware of it, and without the idea f explaining it to himself having occurred to him. He admired his opposite by nstinct. His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached hemselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that irmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once more. He as, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were, to all appearance, ncompatible. He was ironical and cordial. His indifference loved. His mind ould get along without belief, but his heart could not get along without riendship. A profound contradiction; for an affection is a conviction. His ature was thus constituted. There are men who seem to be born to be the everse, the obverse, the wrong side. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, udamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They only exist on condition that they are acked up with another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded y the conjunction _and_; and their existence is not their own; it is the other ide of an existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was he obverse of Enjolras.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.1#In a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac’s friend. Youth is the season or prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius breathed freely in ourfeyrac’s society, a decidedly new thing for him. Courfeyrac put no questions o him. He did not even think of such a thing. At that age, faces disclose verything on the spot. Words are superfluous. There are young men of whom it an be said that their countenances chatter. One looks at them and one knows hem.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.2#One morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation to im:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.3#“By the way, have you any political opinions?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.4#“The idea!” said Marius, almost affronted by the question.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.5#“What are you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.6#“A democrat-Bonapartist.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.7#“The gray hue of a reassured rat,” said Courfeyrac.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.8#On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Café Musain. Then e whispered in his ear, with a smile: “I must give you your entry to the evolution.” And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B C. He resented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word which Marius did ot understand: “A pupil.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.9#Marius had fallen into a wasps’-nest of wits. However, although he was ilent and grave, he was, nonetheless, both winged and armed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.10#Marius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and to asides, oth by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this covey of young men round him. All these various initiatives solicited his attention at once, and ulled him about. The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work et his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes, in his trouble, they fled so far from him, hat he had difficulty in recovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of iterature, of art, of history, of religion, in unexpected fashion. He caught limpses of strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in proper erspective, he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped. n abandoning his grandfather’s opinions for the opinions of his father, he had upposed himself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, and without daring to vow it to himself, that he was not. The angle at which he saw everything began o be displaced anew. A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains n motion. An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered from it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.11#It seemed as though there were no “consecrated things” for those young en. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, which mbarrassed his still timid mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.12#A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy rom the ancient repertory called classic: “Down with tragedy dear to the ourgeois!” cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.13#“You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and the ourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has a reason or its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order of Æschylus, contest ts right to existence. There are rough outlines in nature; there are, in reation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is not a beak, wings which are not ings, gills which are not gills, paws which are not paws, a cry of pain which rouses a desire to laugh, there is the duck. Now, since poultry exists by the ide of the bird, I do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face f antique tragedy.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.14#Or chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau etween Enjolras and Courfeyrac.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.15#Courfeyrac took his arm:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.16#“Pay attention. This is the Rue Plâtrière, now called Rue Jean-Jacques ousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago. his consisted of Jean-Jacques and Thérèse. From time to time, little beings ere born there. Thérèse gave birth to them, Jean-Jacques represented them as oundlings.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.17#And Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.18#“Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He denied his wn children, that may be; but he adopted the people.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.19#Not one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor. Jean rouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said “Bonaparte.” njolras pronounced it “Buonaparte.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.3.20#Marius was vaguely surprised. _Initium sapientiæ_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.head#CHAPTER IV—THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFÉ MUSAIN
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.1#One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was present nd in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.2#This took place in the back room of the Café Musain. Nearly all the Friends f the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was solemnly lighted. hey talked of one thing and another, without passion and with noise. With the xception of Enjolras and Marius, who held their peace, all were haranguing ather at hap-hazard. Conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to hese peaceable tumults. It was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. hey tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering n all quarters.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.3#No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the dish-washer of he café, who passed through it from time to time, to go to her washing in the lavatory.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.4#Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he had taken ossession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs, and houting:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.5#“I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has an ttack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied o it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a hideous invention of I now not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is worth nothing. One breaks one’s eck in living. Life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable ntrances. Happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only. cclesiastes says: ‘All is vanity.’ I agree with that good man, who never xisted, perhaps. Zero not wishing to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. vanity! The patching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is a aboratory, a dancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a ugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an rchitect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro with his lass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher with his rags. I eep over the one and I laugh over the other. What are called honors and ignities, and even dignity and honor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make laythings of human pride. Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a night of a sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and aronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no longer espectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of eighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a setting own it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more enomous than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise would quote to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have lways been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead of daubing wretched ittle pictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples; _rapin_24 is the asculine of _rapine_. So much for myself; as for the rest of you, you are worth o more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, and qualities. very good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the enerous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the raggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many ices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes’ cloak. Whom do you admire, the lain or the slayer, Cæsar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. ong live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but adness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who killed æsar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue was from the hand f the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved that figure of an Amazon nown as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which Nero carried with him in his ravels. This Strongylion left but two statues which placed Nero and Brutus in ccord. Brutus was in love with the one, Nero with the other. All history is othing but wearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. he battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the usterlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water. I don’t ttach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to conquer; true lory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! If you are content with uccess, what mediocrity, and with conquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity nd cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. _Si volet sus_, says Horace. Therefore I disdain the human race. Shall we descend to the arty at all? Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you lease? Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew hocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that nacephorus said of Pisistratus: “His urine attracts the bees.” The most rominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who was so mall and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not o be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great square in Corinth a tatue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented pisthates. What did Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and lory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? rance? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. ngland? Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the etropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred eaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I dd, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of oses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire John Bull, hall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for that slave-holding rother. Take away _Time is money_, what remains of England? Take away _Cotton s king_, what remains of America? Germany is the lymph, Italy is the bile. hall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired it. He also admired hina. I admit that Russia has its beauties, among others, a stout despotism; ut I pity the despots. Their health is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a oignarded Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers vans strangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils oisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in a ondition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer this detail to he admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and sums p all the forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the orges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful ass. ‘Bah!’ you will say to me, ‘but Europe is certainly better than Asia?’ I dmit that Asia is a farce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at n the Grand Lama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions nd your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise f Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human ace, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that the most beer is onsumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at msterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at Constantinople the most offee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are all the useful notions. Paris arries the day, in short. In Paris, even the rag-pickers are sybarites; iogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to e a philosopher at the Piræus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ag-pickers are called _bibines_; the most celebrated are the _Saucepan_ and The Slaughter-House_. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis, astroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers, caravanseries f the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat at Richard’s at forty ous a head, I must have Persian carpets to roll naked Cleopatra in! Where is leopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good day.”

Combeferre was upholding it weakly. ourfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the table lay an nfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac had seized it, and as brandishing it, mingling with his arguments the rattling of this sheet of aper.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.4.4.44#“In the first place, I won’t have any kings; if it were only from an conomical point of view, I don’t want any; a king is a parasite. One does not ave kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. At the death of rançois I., the national debt of France amounted to an income of thirty housand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was two milliards, six hundred illions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which was equivalent in 1760, ccording to Desmarets, to four milliards, five hundred millions, which would o-day be equivalent to twelve milliards. In the second place, and no offence to ombeferre, a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization. To save he transition, to soften the passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation o pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of onstitutional fictions,—what detestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us ever enlighten the people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale in our constitutional cellar. No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grant from the ing to the people. In all such grants there is an Article 14. By the side of he hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back. I refuse your harter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie lurks beneath it.

When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was no longer there. Probably atisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had just taken his departure, and ll, with the exception of Enjolras, had followed him. The room had been mptied. Enjolras, left alone with Marius, was gazing gravely at him. Marius, owever, having rallied his ideas to some extent, did not consider himself eaten; there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the oint, no doubt, of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, hen all of a sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went.

He declared to himself that e would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of himself. To stand between wo religions, from one of which you have not as yet emerged, and another into hich you have not yet entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to at-like souls. Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The alf-lights of doubt pained him. Whatever may have been his desire to remain here he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to ontinue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this ead him? He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him earer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from that ather. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to im. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neither with his randfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind he times in the eyes of the others, and he recognized the fact that he was oubly isolated, on the side of age and on the side of youth. He ceased to go to he Café Musain.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.1.1#Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his atch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called _de la vache nragé_; that is to say, he endured great hardships and privations. A terrible hing it is, containing days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings ithout a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without work, a future without ope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young irls, a door which one finds locked on one at night because one’s rent is not aid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of eighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, isgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how uch are often the only things which one has to devour. At that moment of his xistence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he was eered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At he age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes ore than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the oignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the eeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which estiny casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.1.2#For many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are instances of ravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves step by step in that atal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes. Noble and mysterious triumphs hich no eye beholds, which are requited with no renown, which are saluted with o trumpet blast. Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the ields of battle which have their heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, rander than the heroes who win renown.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.1.3#Firm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always a tep-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might of soul and pirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a good milk for the agnanimous.

Sometimes there ould be seen gliding into the butcher’s shop on the corner, in the midst of the antering cooks who elbowed him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under is arm, who had a timid yet angry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a row whereon stood drops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher’s stonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven sous for it, rapped it up in a paper, put it under his arm, between two books, and went way.

From that time forth, he had not put off is black garments. But his garments were quitting him. The day came when he had o longer a coat. The trousers would go next. What was to be done? Courfeyrac, o whom he had, on his side, done some good turns, gave him an old coat. For hirty sous, Marius got it turned by some porter or other, and it was a new oat. But this coat was green. Then Marius ceased to go out until after ightfall. This made his coat black. As he wished always to appear in mourning, e clothed himself with the night.

This furniture belonged to him. He gave hree francs a month to the old _principal tenant_ to come and sweep his hole, nd to bring him a little hot water every morning, a fresh egg, and a penny oll. He breakfasted on this egg and roll. His breakfast varied in cost from two o four sous, according as eggs were dear or cheap. At six o’clock in the vening he descended the Rue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau’s, opposite asset’s, the stamp-dealer’s, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no oup. He took a six-sou plate of meat, a half-portion of vegetables for three ous, and a three-sou dessert. For three sous he got as much bread as he wished. s for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk where Madam Rousseau, at hat period still plump and rosy majestically presided, he gave a sou to the aiter, and Madam Rousseau gave him a smile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous e had a smile and a dinner.

Add the hirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the old woman, plus a few rifling expenses; for four hundred and fifty francs, Marius was fed, lodged, nd waited on. His clothing cost him a hundred francs, his linen fifty francs, is washing fifty francs; the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs. e was rich. He sometimes lent ten francs to a friend. Courfeyrac had once been ble to borrow sixty francs of him. As far as fire was concerned, as Marius had o fireplace, he had “simplified matters.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.2.6#Marius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, “for every ay”; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were black. He had but hree shirts, one on his person, the second in the commode, and the third in the asherwoman’s hands. He renewed them as they wore out. They were always ragged, hich caused him to button his coat to the chin.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.2.7#It had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishing condition. ard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to climb. Marius had ot failed for a single day. He had endured everything in the way of estitution; he had done everything except contract debts. He did himself the ustice to say that he had never owed any one a sou. A debt was, to him, the eginning of slavery. He even said to himself, that a creditor is worse than a aster; for the master possesses only your person, a creditor possesses your ignity and can administer to it a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went ithout food. He had passed many a day fasting. Feeling that all extremes meet, nd that, if one is not on one’s guard, lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of oul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. Such and such a formality or action, hich, in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to him, now eemed insipidity, and he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort of evere flush. He was timid even to rudeness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.2.8#During all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted, t times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself. The soul aids the ody, and at certain moments, raises it. It is the only bird which bears up its wn cage.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.2.9#Besides his father’s name, another name was graven in Marius’ heart, the ame of Thénardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature, surrounded ith a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts, he owed his father’s ife,—that intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the annon-balls of Waterloo. He never separated the memory of this man from the emory of his father, and he associated them in his veneration. It was a sort of orship in two steps, with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one or Thénardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards hénardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew that Thénardier had allen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius had learned at Montfermeil of he ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate inn-keeper. Since that time, he had ade unheard-of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark byss of misery in which Thénardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole ountry; he had gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He ad persisted for three years, expending in these explorations the little money hich he had laid by. No one had been able to give him any news of Thénardier: e was supposed to have gone abroad. His creditors had also sought him, with ess love than Marius, but with as much assiduity, and had not been able to lay heir hands on him. Marius blamed himself, and was almost angry with himself for is lack of success in his researches. It was the only debt left him by the olonel, and Marius made it a matter of honor to pay it. “What,” he thought, when my father lay dying on the field of battle, did Thénardier contrive to ind him amid the smoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off on his shoulders, nd yet he owed him nothing, and I, who owe so much to Thénardier, cannot join im in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in my turn bring im back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!” To find Thénardier, in fact, arius would have given one of his arms, to rescue him from his misery, he would ave sacrificed all his blood. To see Thénardier, to render Thénardier some ervice, to say to him: “You do not know me; well, I do know you! Here I am. ispose of me!” This was Marius’ sweetest and most magnificent dream.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.head#CHAPTER III—MARIUS GROWN UP
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.1#At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years since he ad left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same terms, without ttempting to approach each other, and without seeking to see each other. esides, what was the use of seeing each other? Marius was the brass vase, while ather Gillenormand was the iron pot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.2#We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather’s heart. He had magined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty, harsh, nd smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed and brandished his cane, herished for him, at the most, only that affection, which is at once slight and evere, of the dotards of comedy. Marius was in error. There are fathers who do ot love their children; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his randson. At bottom, as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He dolized him after his own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and oxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart; e would allow no one to mention the child to him, and all the while secretly egretted that he was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, his Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return. But the weeks assed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand’s great despair, the “blood-drinker” id not make his appearance. “I could not do otherwise than turn him out,” said he grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: “If the thing were to do over gain, would I do it?” His pride instantly answered “yes,” but his aged head, hich he shook in silence, replied sadly “no.” He had his hours of depression. e missed Marius. Old men need affection as they need the sun. It is warmth. trong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him. othing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards “that rogue”; ut he suffered. He never inquired about him, but he thought of him incessantly. e lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner; he was still merry and iolent as of old, but his merriment had a convulsive harshness, and his iolences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection. He ometimes said: “Oh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would ive him!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.3#As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no longer or her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually came to occupy erself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably ad. What augmented Father Gillenormand’s secret suffering was, that he locked t all up within his breast, and did not allow its existence to be divined. His orrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. t sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and sked him: “What is your grandson doing?” “What has become of him?” The old ourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a fillip to is cuff, if he wished to appear gay: “Monsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is ractising pettifogging in some corner or other.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.4#While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case with ll good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness. He only hought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set his mind on not eceiving anything more from the man who _had been unkind to his father_. This as the mitigated translation of his first indignation. Moreover, he was happy t having suffered, and at suffering still. It was for his father’s sake. The ardness of his life satisfied and pleased him. He said to himself with a sort f joy that— _it was certainly the least he could do_; that it was an xpiation;—that, had it not been for that, he would have been punished in some ther way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such father! that it would not have been just that his father should have all the uffering, and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his toils and his estitution compared with the colonel’s heroic life? that, in short, the only ay for him to approach his father and resemble him, was to be brave in the face f indigence, as the other had been valiant before the enemy; and that that was, o doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by the words: “He will be worthy f it.” Words which Marius continued to wear, not on his breast, since the olonel’s writing had disappeared, but in his heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.5#And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors, he ad been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we repeat, had been ood for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has this magnificent property bout it, that it turns the whole will towards effort, and the whole soul owards aspiration. Poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it ideous; hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life. The wealthy young an has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions, horse races, hunting, dogs, obacco, gaming, good repasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser ide of the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides. The oor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, he as nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes ratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity mong which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. He gazes so much n humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes upon creation to such an extent hat he beholds God. He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels imself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the ompassion of the man who meditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, orgetfulness of self and pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable njoyments which nature offers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, nd refuses to souls that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of he mind, the millionnaire of money. All hatred departs from his heart, in roportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is he unhappy? No. The misery of young man is never miserable. The first young lad who comes to hand, however oor he may be, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant yes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his white eeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor. And hen, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread; nd while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain athers ideas. His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to ontemplation, to joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on he pavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light. He s firm, serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, indly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches hich many a rich man lacks: work, which makes him free; and thought, which akes him dignified.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.6#This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a ittle too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had succeeded n earning his living with some approach to certainty, he had stopped, thinking t good to be poor, and retrenching time from his work to give to thought; that s to say, he sometimes passed entire days in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, ike a visionary, in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He ad thus propounded the problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at aterial labor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is mpalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to cast the est to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing, he did not perceive hat contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming one of the forms of dleness; that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities f life, and that he was resting from his labors too soon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.7#It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, this could nly be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against the inevitable omplications of destiny, Marius would awaken.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.8#In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father Gillenormand hought about the matter, he was not practising, he was not even pettifogging. editation had turned him aside from pleading. To haunt attorneys, to follow the ourt, to hunt up cases—what a bore! Why should he do it? He saw no reason for hanging the manner of gaining his livelihood! The obscure and ill-paid ublishing establishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which id not involve too much labor, as we have explained, and which sufficed for his ants.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.9#One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered to ake him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him with regular ccupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year. To be well lodged! ifteen hundred francs! No doubt. But renounce his liberty! Be on fixed wages! A ort of hired man of letters! According to Marius’ opinion, if he accepted, his osition would become both better and worse at the same time, he acquired omfort, and lost his dignity; it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted nto a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture: something like the case of a lind man who should recover the sight of one eye. He refused.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.10#Marius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste for remaining outside of verything, and through having been too much alarmed, he had not entered ecidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remained good riends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every possible way; ut nothing more. Marius had two friends: one young, Courfeyrac; and one old, M. abeuf. He inclined more to the old man. In the first place, he owed to him the evolution which had taken place within him; to him he was indebted for having nown and loved his father. “He operated on me for a cataract,” he said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.11#The churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.12#It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm and mpassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had enlightened Marius by hance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candle which some one rings; he had been the candle and not the some one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.3.13#As for Marius’ inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totally ncapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.head#CHAPTER IV—M. MABEUF
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.1#On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: “Certainly I approve of political pinions,” he expressed the real state of his mind. All political opinions were atters of indifference to him, and he approved them all, without distinction, rovided they left him in peace, as the Greeks called the Furies “the beautiful, he good, the charming,” the Eumenides. M. Mabeuf’s political opinion consisted n a passionate love for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of he world, he possessed the termination in _ist_, without which no one could xist at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, an rleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a _bouquinist_, a collector of old books. He id not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because f silly stuff like the charter, democracy, legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, tc., when there were in the world all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs hich they might be looking at, and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which hey might turn over. He took good care not to become useless; having books did ot prevent his reading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener. hen he made Pontmercy’s acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between the olonel and himself—that what the colonel did for flowers, he did for fruits. M. abeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory as the pears of St. ermain; it is from one of his combinations, apparently, that the October irabelle, now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes ts origin. He went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety, and because, s he loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled and ilent only in church. Feeling that he must be something in the State, he had hosen the career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in loving any woman s much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir. He had long passed ixty, when, one day, some one asked him: “Have you never been married?” “I have orgotten,” said he. When it sometimes happened to him—and to whom does it not appen?—to say: “Oh! if I were only rich!” it was not when ogling a pretty girl, s was the case with Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book. He ived alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, and when he was sleep, his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the folds f his sheets. He had composed and published a _Flora of the Environs of auteretz_, with colored plates, a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of steem and which sold well. People rang his bell, in the Rue Mésières, two or hree times a day, to ask for it. He drew as much as two thousand francs a year rom it; this constituted nearly the whole of his fortune. Although poor, he had ad the talent to form for himself, by dint of patience, privations, and time, a recious collection of rare copies of every sort. He never went out without a ook under his arm, and he often returned with two. The sole decoration of the our rooms on the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed erbariums, and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or a gun hilled his blood. He had never approached a cannon in his life, even at the nvalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a curé, perfectly white air, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling in every limb, a icard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep, and he was easily rightened. Add to this, that he had no other friendship, no other acquaintance mong the living, than an old bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named oyal. His dream was to naturalize indigo in France.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.2#His servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman was a pinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri’s miserere in the ixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion hich existed in her. None of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man. She ad never been able to get further than her cat. Like him, she had a moustache. er glory consisted in her caps, which were always white. She passed her time, n Sundays, after mass, in counting over the linen in her chest, and in preading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought and never had ade up. She knew how to read. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.3#M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young and entle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combined with entleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without wind. When arius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder, with marches and ountermarches, and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had iven and received such tremendous blows of the sword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, nd M. Mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of view of flowers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.4#His brother the curé died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when the ight is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A notary’s ailure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was all that he ossessed in his brother’s right and his own. The Revolution of July brought a risis to publishing. In a period of embarrassment, the first thing which does ot sell is a _Flora. The Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz_ stopped short. eeks passed by without a single purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the ound of the bell. “Monsieur,” said Mother Plutarque sadly, “it is the ater-carrier.” In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mésières, abdicated he functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of his books, ut of his prints,—that to which he was the least attached,—and installed imself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained ut one quarter for two reasons: in the first place, the ground floor and the arden cost three hundred francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred rancs on his rent; in the second, being near Faton’s shooting-gallery, he could ear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.5#He carried off his _Flora_, his copper-plates, his herbariums, his ortfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salpêtrière, in a ort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where, for fifty crowns a ear, he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge, and containing a ell. He took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture. On he day of his entrance into his new quarters, he was very gay, and drove the ails on which his engravings and herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, ug in his garden the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother lutarque had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the houlder and said to her with a smile: “We have the indigo!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.6#Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius, ere admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling name which as, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.7#However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in some bit f wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are but slowly ccessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny is a far-off thing to hem. There results from such concentration a passivity, which, if it were the utcome of reasoning, would resemble philosophy. One declines, descends, rickles away, even crumbles away, and yet is hardly conscious of it one’s self. t always ends, it is true, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the eantime, it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is oing on between our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we ook on at the game with indifference.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.8#It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his opes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather uerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular swing of a endulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very long time, even after he illusion had disappeared. A clock does not stop short at the precise moment hen the key is lost.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.9#M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive and nexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother Plutarque was eading a romance in one corner of the room. She was reading aloud, finding that he understood better thus. To read aloud is to assure one’s self of what one is eading. There are people who read very loud, and who have the appearance of iving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.10#It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading the omance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening to her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.11#In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It was question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.4.14#“Bouddha and the Dragon,” struck in M.

Many stars had already been onsumed by this monster, which, besides, had the claws of a tiger. Bouddha went nto its den and succeeded in converting the dragon. That is a good book that ou are reading, Mother Plutarque. There is no more beautiful legend in xistence.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.5.1#Marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the lutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, little by little, ithout, however, being made melancholy by it. Marius met Courfeyrac and sought ut M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a month at most.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.5.2#Marius’ pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer oulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys of the uxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden, the beds of ettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse turning the water-wheel. The assers-by stared at him in surprise, and some of them thought his attire uspicious and his mien sinister. He was only a poor young man dreaming in an bjectless way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.5.3#It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house, nd, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up his abode there. e was known there only under the name of M. Marius.

Marius had not refused their invitations. hey afforded opportunities of talking about his father. Thus he went from time o time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne, to General Fririon, to the nvalides. There was music and dancing there. On such evenings, Marius put on is new coat. But he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days hen it was freezing cold, because he could not afford a carriage, and he did ot wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.5.5#He said sometimes, but without bitterness: “Men are so made that in a rawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In order to nsure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing is asked of you; our conscience? No, your boots.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.5.5.6#All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by reverie. Marius’ olitical fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in the process, y satisfying and calming him. He remained the same, setting aside his fits of rath. He still held the same opinions. Only, they had been tempered. To speak ccurately, he had no longer any opinions, he had sympathies. To what party did e belong? To the party of humanity. Out of humanity he chose France; out of the ation he chose the people; out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that oint above all, that his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea to a deed, poet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job more than an event like arengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation, he returned in the vening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse through the branches of the rees of the fathomless space beyond, the nameless gleams, the abyss, the hadow, the mystery, all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to im.

In this state of reverie, an eye hich could have cast a glance into Marius’ interior would have been dazzled ith the purity of that soul. In fact, had it been given to our eyes of the lesh to gaze into the consciences of others, we should be able to judge a man uch more surely according to what he dreams, than according to what he thinks. here is will in thought, there is none in dreams. Reverie, which is utterly pontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and the ideal, the form of ur spirit. Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very epth of our soul, than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the plendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in deliberate, ational co-ordinated ideas, is the real character of a man to be found. Our himæras are the things which the most resemble us. Each one of us dreams of the nknown and the impossible in accordance with his nature.

The “sheet” which he held, although Royalist, of ourse, announced for the following day, without any softening phrases, one of hese little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in Paris: “That he students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the Place du anthéon, at midday,—to deliberate.” The discussion concerned one of the uestions of the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict etween the Minister of War and “the citizen’s militia,” on the subject of the annon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.head#CHAPTER I—THE SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.1#Marius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature, with hick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow, well-opened and assionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity, and with something ndescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent over his whole countenance. His rofile, all of whose lines were rounded, without thereby losing their firmness, ad a certain Germanic sweetness, which has made its way into the French hysiognomy by way of Alsace and Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles hich rendered the Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which istinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that period of life hen the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equal parts, of depth and ngenuousness. A grave situation being given, he had all that is required to be tupid: one more turn of the key, and he might be sublime. His manners were eserved, cold, polished, not very genial. As his mouth was charming, his lips he reddest, and his teeth the whitest in the world, his smile corrected the everity of his face, as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that oluptuous smile presented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his lance was large.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.2#At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young girls urned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death in his soul. He hought that they were staring at him because of his old clothes, and that they ere laughing at them; the fact is, that they stared at him because of his race, and that they dreamed of him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.3#This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had made im shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason that he fled from all of hem. He lived thus indefinitely,—stupidly, as Courfeyrac said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.4#Courfeyrac also said to him: “Do not aspire to be venerable” [they called ach other _thou_; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slip into this ode of address]. “Let me give you a piece of advice, my dear fellow. Don’t read o many books, and look a little more at the lasses. The jades have some good oints about them, O Marius! By dint of fleeing and blushing, you will become rutalized.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.5#On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:—“Good morning, onsieur l’Abbé!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.6#When Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, Marius voided women, both young and old, more than ever for a week to come, and he voided Courfeyrac to boot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.7#Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women hom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In truth, e would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that they were omen. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber, and caused ourfeyrac to say: “Seeing that his servant woman wears his beard, Marius does ot wear his own beard.” The other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very ften, and whom he never looked at.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.8#For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of the uxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pépinière, a man and a very oung girl, who were almost always seated side by side on the same bench, at the ost solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de l’Ouest side. Every time that that hance which meddles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, ed Marius to that walk,—and it was nearly every day,—he found this couple here. The man appeared to be about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and erious; his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to ilitary men who have retired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, arius would have said: “He is an ex-officer.” He had a kindly but napproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. e wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which always ppeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, it was azzlingly white, but of coarse linen. A grisette who passed near him one day, aid: “Here’s a very tidy widower.” His hair was very white.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.9#The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated erself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort of child hirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almost homely, awkward, nsignificant, and with a possible promise of handsome eyes. Only, they were lways raised with a sort of displeasing assurance. Her dress was both aged and hildish, like the dress of the scholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly ut gown of black merino. They had the air of being father and daughter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.10#Marius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this little girl, ho was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no attention to hem. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him. They conversed ogether with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl chattered incessantly and errily. The old man talked but little, and, at times, he fixed on her eyes verflowing with an ineffable paternity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.11#Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. He nvariably found them there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.12#This is the way things went:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.13#Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from heir bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front of them, hen returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began again. This he did ive or six times in the course of his promenade, and the promenade was taken ive or six times a week, without its having occurred to him or to these people o exchange a greeting. That personage, and that young girl, although they ppeared,—and perhaps because they appeared,—to shun all glances, had, aturally, caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who trolled along the Pépinière from time to time; the studious after their ectures, the others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among he last, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he had peedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, discharging at them a obriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely with the child’s gown and the ld man’s hair, he had dubbed the daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, onsieur Leblanc, so that as no one knew them under any other title, this ickname became a law in the default of any other name. The students said: “Ah! onsieur Leblanc is on his bench.” And Marius, like the rest, had found it onvenient to call this unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.14#We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order to acilitate this tale.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.1.15#So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the first ear. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.head#CHAPTER II—LUX FACTA EST
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.1#During the second year, precisely at the point in this history which the eader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg was nterrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly six months lapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley. One day, at last, he eturned thither once more; it was a serene summer morning, and Marius was in oyous mood, as one is when the weather is fine. It seemed to him that he had in is heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits f blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.2#He went straight to “his alley,” and when he reached the end of it he erceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when he pproached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that it was no onger the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful reature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise oment when they are still combined with all the most ingenuous graces of the hild; a pure and fugitive moment, which can be expressed only by these two ords,—“fifteen years.” She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of old, a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a ale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like unbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, et upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus. And, in order hat nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose was not andsome—it was pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; t was the Parisian nose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, ure,—which drives painters to despair, and charms poets.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.3#When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which were onstantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated with shadow nd modesty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.4#This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to hat the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could be more ascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.5#For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man, sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit of his stroll rought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had examined her ttentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months the little girl had ecome a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is more frequent than this henomenon. There is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye, nd become roses all at once. One left them children but yesterday; today, one inds them disquieting to the feelings.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.6#This child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three days in pril suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, six months had sufficed to lothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.7#One sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, pass uddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all sorts, and ecome dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden. That is the result of aving pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday. The young girl had eceived her quarterly income.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.8#And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her merino own, her scholar’s shoes, and red hands; taste had come to her with beauty; she as a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of rich and simple elegance, and ithout affectation. She wore a dress of black damask, a cape of the same aterial, and a bonnet of white crape. Her white gloves displayed the delicacy f the hand which toyed with the carved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and er silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, er whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.9#As for the man, he was the same as usual.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.10#The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised her yelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiled azure, here was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked at Marius ndifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running beneath the ycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the bench, and Marius, on is side, continued his promenade, and thought about something else.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.11#He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times, but ithout even turning his eyes in her direction.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.2.12#On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg; as sual, he found there “the father and daughter;” but he paid no further ttention to them. He thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful han he had when she was homely. He passed very near the bench where she sat, ecause such was his habit.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.3.1#One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light and hade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning, the parrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the hestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature, he was not hinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed near the bench, he young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.3.2#What was there in the young girl’s glance on this occasion? Marius could ot have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was a strange lash.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.3.6#That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is like the awn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant and strange. Nothing an give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam, which flashes uddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows, and which is composed of all he innocence of the present, and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort f undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance, and which waits. It is a nare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she aptures hearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking ike a woman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.3.7#It is rare that a profound reverie does not spring from that glance, where t falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam hich, more than all the best-planned tender glances of coquettes, possesses the agic power of causing the sudden blossoming, in the depths of the soul, of that ombre flower, impregnated with perfume and with poison, which is called ove.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.1#On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his wardrobe is new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his new boots; he clothed imself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, a tremendous luxury, and et off for the Luxembourg.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.2#On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see im. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.3#“I have just met Marius’ new hat and new coat, with Marius inside them. He as going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly stupid.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.4#On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain basin, nd stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplation efore a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould, and one of whose hips as missing. Near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age, with a rominent stomach, who was holding by the hand a little urchin of five, and aying to him: “Shun excess, my son, keep at an equal distance from despotism nd from anarchy.” Marius listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit f the basin once more. At last he directed his course towards “his alley,” lowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go here and withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thought hat he was doing as he always did.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.5#On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at the other nd, “on their bench.” He buttoned his coat up to the very top, pulled it down n his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined, with a certain omplaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, and marched on the bench. his march savored of an attack, and certainly of a desire for conquest. So I ay that he marched on the bench, as I should say: “Hannibal marched on ome.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.6#However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had interrupted one of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors. At that moment, he as thinking that the _Manuel du Baccalauréat_ was a stupid book, and that it ust have been drawn up by rare idiots, to allow of three tragedies of Racine nd only one comedy of Molière being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the uman mind. There was a piercing whistling going on in his ears. As he pproached the bench, he held fast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes n the young girl. It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the lley with a vague blue light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.7#In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On rriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had reached he end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himself why he retraced is steps. He did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the nd. It was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in he distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he eld himself very erect, in case any one should be looking at him from ehind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.8#He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he approached a ittle nearer to the bench. He even got to within three intervals of trees, but here he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further, and he esitated. He thought he saw the young girl’s face bending towards him. But he xerted a manly and violent effort, subdued his hesitation, and walked straight head. A few seconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, eddening to the very ears, without daring to cast a glance either to the right r to the left, with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman. At the oment when he passed,—under the cannon of the place,—he felt his heart beat ildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crape bonnet. e heard an ineffable voice, which must have been “her voice.” She was talking ranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, although he made no attempt to see er. “She could not, however,” he thought, “help feeling esteem and onsideration for me, if she only knew that I am the veritable author of the issertation on Marcos Obrégon de la Ronde, which M. François de Neufchâteau ut, as though it were his own, at the head of his edition of _Gil Blas_.” He ent beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk, which was very near, hen turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl. This ime, he was very pale. Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable. As he went urther from the bench and the young girl, and while his back was turned to her, e fancied that she was gazing after him, and that made him stumble.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.9#He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the middle f the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down, and reflecting n the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit, that after all, it was ard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be bsolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.10#At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were on he point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded y an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless. For the first time in ifteen months, he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day ith his daughter, had, on his side, noticed him, and probably considered his ssiduity singular.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.11#For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence in esignating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the sobriquet of M. eblanc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.12#He stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figures in he sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.13#Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M. eblanc and his daughter, and went home.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.4.14#That day he forgot to dine. At eight o’clock in the evening he perceived his fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques, he said: Never mind!” and ate a bit of bread.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.5.2#He went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than his ench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the preceding day, urveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the white bonnet, the black ress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stir from it, and only went ome when the gates of the Luxembourg closed. He did not see M. Leblanc and his aughter retire. He concluded that they had quitted the garden by the gate on he Rue de l’Ouest. Later on, several weeks afterwards, when he came to think it ver, he could never recall where he had dined that evening.

Marius approached as near as he ould, pretending to be busy reading a book, but he halted afar off, then eturned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four hours in watching he house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and who produced on him the mpression that they were making sport of him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.5.7#A fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for the ake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same spot, and that ithout knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not stir. He put on his new coat very morning, for the purpose of not showing himself, and he began all over gain on the morrow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.5.8#She was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching a riticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between her gaze, hich was melancholy, and her smile, which was merry, gave a rather wild effect o her face, which sometimes caused this sweet countenance to become strange ithout ceasing to be charming.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.head#CHAPTER VI—TAKEN PRISONER
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.1#On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his bench, s usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not turned a page or the last two hours. All at once he started. An event was taking place at the ther extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat, nd the daughter had taken her father’s arm, and both were advancing slowly, owards the middle of the alley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then pened it again, then forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was oming straight towards him. “Ah! good Heavens!” thought he, “I shall not have ime to strike an attitude.” Still the white-haired man and the girl advanced. t seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that it was but a second. What are they coming in this direction for?” he asked himself. “What! She will ass here? Her feet will tread this sand, this walk, two paces from me?” He was tterly upset, he would have liked to be very handsome, he would have liked to wn the cross. He heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching ootsteps. He imagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. “Is hat gentleman going to address me?” he thought to himself. He dropped his head; hen he raised it again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as he passed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him, with a pensive weetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot. It seemed to him that she was eproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse without coming as ar as her, and that she was saying to him: “I am coming myself.” Marius was azzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.2#He felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, how she ad looked at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her et. Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic, with a omplete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing and Dante kneel. It seemed o him that he was floating free in the azure heavens. At the same time, he was orribly vexed because there was dust on his boots.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.3#He thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.4#He followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he started up and alked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible that, at times, e laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamy when he came near the hildren’s nurses, that each one of them thought him in love with her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.5#He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.6#He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odéon, and said to him: Come and dine with me.” They went off to Rousseau’s and spent six francs. arius ate like an ogre.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.9#At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging from he theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was stepping cross a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said: “I should like to put that woman in y collection,” almost horrified him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.10#Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Café Voltaire on the following orning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the preceding evening. e was very thoughtful and very merry. One would have said that he was taking dvantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously. He tenderly embraced some man r other from the provinces, who was presented to him. A circle of students ormed round the table, and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State hich was uttered from the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation fell pon the faults and omissions in Guicherat’s dictionaries and grammars. Marius nterrupted the discussion to exclaim: “But it is very agreeable, all the same o have the cross!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.6.17#The glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which are ranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them every day, eaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything. A moment rrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and come, dream, speak, augh. All at once you feel yourself clutched; all is over. The wheels hold you ast, the glance has ensnared you. It has caught you, no matter where or how, by ome portion of your thought which was fluttering loose, by some distraction hich had attacked you. You are lost. The whole of you passes into it. A chain f mysterious forces takes possession of you. You struggle in vain; no more uman succor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing, from agony o agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune, your future, our soul; and, according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature, r of a noble heart, you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwise han disfigured with shame, or transfigured by passion.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.7.1#Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, the taste of ature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life within himself, the ecret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation, had repared Marius for this possession which is called passion. His worship of his ather had gradually become a religion, and, like all religions, it had etreated to the depths of his soul. Something was required in the foreground. ove came.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.7.2#A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to the Luxembourg. hen the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.—“He is on duty,” said ourfeyrac. Marius lived in a state of delight. It is certain that the young irl did look at him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.7.3#He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did not pass n front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the nstinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it better not to attract the attention of the father.” He combined his stations behind the trees and the edestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as uch as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old entleman. Sometimes, he remained motionless by the half-hour together in the hade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his yes, gently raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned her harming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in the most atural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, she bent pon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye. Ancient and ime-honored manœuvre which Eve understood from the very first day of the world, nd which every woman understands from the very first day of her life! her mouth eplied to one, and her glance replied to another.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.7.4#It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, for often, hen Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had abandoned their ccustomed place and had adopted the bench by the Gladiator, near the other end f the walk, as though with the object of seeing whether Marius would pursue hem thither. Marius did not understand, and committed this error. “The father” egan to grow inexact, and no longer brought “his daughter” every day. ometimes, he came alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.7.5#Marius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, he had assed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness. His love ncreased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, an unexpected bliss had appened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes. One vening, at dusk, he had found, on the bench which “M. Leblanc and his daughter” ad just quitted, a handkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, without mbroidery, but white, and fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable erfume. He seized it with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the etters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,—neither her family ame, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first thing f her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, upon which he mmediately began to construct his scaffolding. U was evidently the Christian ame. “Ursule!” he thought, “what a delicious name!” He kissed the handkerchief, rank it in, placed it on his heart, on his flesh, during the day, and at night, aid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it.

It was on one of the days when she persuaded M. eblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk. A brisk May breeze was lowing, which swayed the crests of the plaintain-trees. The father and aughter, arm in arm, had just passed Marius’ bench. Marius had risen to his eet behind them, and was following them with his eyes, as was fitting in the esperate situation of his soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.8.2#All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably charged ith performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from the nursery, flung tself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver, worthy of irgil’s nymphs, and the fawns of Theocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe ore sacred than that of Isis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of xquisite shape appeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.8.3#The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely troubled otion, but he was nonetheless angry for all that. He was alone in the alley, it s true. But there might have been some one there. And what if there had been ome one there! Can any one comprehend such a thing? What she had just done is orrible!—Alas, the poor child had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, he wind; but Marius, in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was etermined to be vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, hat the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart, nd takes possession of it, even without any right. Moreover, setting aside even hat jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable or him; the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have fforded him more pleasure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.8.4#When “his Ursule,” after having reached the end of the walk, retraced her teps with M.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.6.8.6#Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one rossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled, and ale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast the little val plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier’s cross of aint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm ithin it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thought he perceived that his man had an extremely well satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged ynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very erry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and s though they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did that relic f Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed between that wooden leg and he other? Marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy.—“Perhaps he was there!” he aid to himself; “perhaps he saw!”—And he felt a desire to exterminate the eteran.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.head#CHAPTER I—MINES AND MINERS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.1#Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, _a third ower floor_. The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes for good, ometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the other. There are uperior mines and inferior mines. There is a top and a bottom in this obscure ub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneath civilization, and which our ndifference and heedlessness trample under foot. The Encyclopedia, in the last entury, was a mine that was almost open to the sky. The shades, those sombre atchers of primitive Christianity, only awaited an opportunity to bring about n explosion under the Cæsars and to inundate the human race with light. For in he sacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadow that s capable of flashing forth. Every form begins by being night. The catacombs, n which the first mass was said, were not alone the cellar of Rome, they were he vaults of the world.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.2#Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure, here are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, the hilosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such and such a ick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such another with wrath. eople hail and answer each other from one catacomb to another. Utopias travel bout underground, in the pipes. There they branch out in every direction. They ometimes meet, and fraternize there. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, ho lends him his lantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes ocinius by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all hese energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity, which goes nd comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these obscurities, and which mmense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside nd the outside. Society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its urface intact and changes its bowels. There are as many different subterranean tages as there are varying works, as there are extractions. What emerges from hese deep excavations? The future.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.3#The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work is good, p to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize; beyond that egree it is doubtful and mixed; lower down, it becomes terrible. At a certain epth, the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization, he limit breathable by man has been passed; a beginning of monsters is ossible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.4#The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of this adder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, and where one ncounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, sometimes misshapen. Below ohn Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there is Descartes; below Descartes, here is Voltaire; below Voltaire, there is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is obespierre; below Robespierre, there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And o it goes on. Lower down, confusedly, at the limit which separates the ndistinct from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps do ot exist as yet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those of to-morrow are orms. The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The embryonic ork of the future is one of the visions of philosophy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.5#A world in limbo, in the state of fœtus, what an unheard-of spectre!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.7#Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves, binds ogether all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, think themselves solated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, and the light of some ontrasts with the blaze of others. The first are paradisiacal, the last are ragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be the contrast, all these toilers, from the ighest to the most nocturnal, from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one ikeness, and this is it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. hey throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not of hemselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute. The first as the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though he may be, has till, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite. Venerate the man, hoever he may be, who has this sign—the starry eye.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.8#The shadowy eye is the other sign.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.1.9#With it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one who as no glance at all. The social order has its black miners.

A formidable spot. This is what we have designated as the _le roisième dessous_. It is the grave of shadows. It is the cellar of the blind. Inferi_.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.2.1#There disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; each one s for himself. The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, and gnaws. The social golino is in this gulf.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.2.2#The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almost phantoms, re not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant both of the idea and f the word; they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their ndividual desires. They are almost unconscious, and there exists within them a ort of terrible obliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, gnorance and misery. They have a guide, necessity; and for all forms of atisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say, ferocious, ot after the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion of the tiger. From uffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy creation, logic f darkness. That which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer omplaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest of matter. Man there ecomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty—that is the point of departure; to e Satan—that is the point reached. From that vault Lacenaire emerges.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.2.3#We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of the upper ine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophical excavation. here, as we have just said, all is pure, noble, dignified, honest. There, ssuredly, one might be misled; but error is worthy of veneration there, so horoughly does it imply heroism. The work there effected, taken as a whole has name: Progress.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.2.4#The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths, hideous epths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon this point, and there will xist, until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated, the great cavern of vil.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.2.5#This cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, without xception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has never cut a pen. ts blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand. ever have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling, urned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper.

It ot only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social order; it ndermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, it undermines civilization, t undermines revolution, it undermines progress.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.1#A quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnasse overned the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.2#Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had the ewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles were of arble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern, his torso that of colossus, his head that of a bird. One thought one beheld the Farnese Hercules lad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this culptural fashion, might have subdued monsters; he had found it more xpeditious to be one. A low brow, large temples, less than forty years of age, ut with crow’s-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like that f a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles called for ork, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great, idle force. He was an ssassin through coolness. He was thought to be a creole. He had, probably, omewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having been a porter at Avignon in 1815. fter this stage, he had turned ruffian.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.3#The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer. Babet as thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable. Daylight was visible hrough his bones, but nothing through his eyes. He declared that he was a hemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He had played in vaudeville at aint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a fine talker, who underlined his smiles nd accentuated his gestures. His occupation consisted in selling, in the open ir, plaster busts and portraits of “the head of the State.” In addition to his, he extracted teeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned booth with a trumpet and this poster: “Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the cademies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, ndertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price: one tooth, one ranc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs, fifty. ake advantage of this opportunity.” This _Take advantage of this opportunity_ eant: Have as many teeth extracted as possible. He had been married and had had hildren. He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He had lost hem as one loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception n the world to which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his family ith him in his booth on wheels, he had read in the _Messager_, that a woman had ust given birth to a child, who was doing well, and had a calf’s muzzle, and he xclaimed: “There’s a fortune! my wife has not the wit to present me with a hild like that!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.4#Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to “undertake Paris.” This as his expression.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.5#Who was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed with lack, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the hole whither e returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one knew. He only addressed is accomplices in the most absolute darkness, and with his back turned to them. as his name Claquesous? Certainly not. If a candle was brought, he put on a ask. He was a ventriloquist. Babet said: “Claquesous is a nocturne for two oices.” Claquesous was vague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether e had a name, Claquesous being a sobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, s his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice; no one was sure that he had face, as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared as though he had anished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as though he sprang from the arth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.6#A lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; less than wenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, charming black air, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had all vices and spired to all crimes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.3.7#The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was the treet boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He was genteel, ffeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim of his hat was curled p on the left side, in order to make room for a tuft of hair, after the style f 1829. He lived by robbery with violence. His coat was of the best cut, but hreadbare. Montparnasse was a fashion-plate in misery and given to the ommission of murders. The cause of all this youth’s crimes was the desire to be ell-dressed. The first grisette who had said to him: “You are handsome!” had ast the stain of darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel. inding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the height of legance is idleness; idleness in a poor man means crime. Few prowlers were so readed as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses in his ast. More than one passer-by lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this retch, with his face in a pool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the ips of a woman, the bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from he boulevard wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon in is pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of the epulchre.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.4.1#These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent among he police, and striving to escape Vidocq’s indiscreet glances “under divers orms, tree, flame, fountain,” lending each other their names and their traps, iding in their own shadows, boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each ther, stripping off their personalities, as one removes his false nose at a asked ball, sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one ndividual, sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latour imself took them for a whole throng.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.4.2#These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber ith four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that monstrous olyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.4.3#Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying their elations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were charged with the eneral enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the Seine. The inventors f ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal imaginations, applied to them to ave their ideas executed. They furnished the canvas to the four rascals, and he latter undertook the preparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage etting. They were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and uitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were ufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they under-let their ccomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of ll underground tragedies.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.4.4#They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they woke p, on the plains which adjoin the Salpêtrière. There they held their onferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they regulated their mployment accordingly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.7.4.5#_Patron-Minette_,—such was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean irculation on the association of these four men. In the fantastic, ancient, opular parlance, which is vanishing day by day, _Patron-Minette_ signifies the orning, the same as _entre chien et loup_—between dog and wolf—signifies the vening. This appellation, _Patron-Minette_, was probably derived from the hour t which their work ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and or the separation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title. When he President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and questioned him oncerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, “Who did it?” demanded the resident. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical so far as the magistrate as concerned, but clear to the police: “Perhaps it was Patron-Minette.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.1.3#He heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. “Why did I follow her? I was so appy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not that immense? She had he air of loving me. Was not that everything? I wished to have, what? There was othing after that. I have been absurd. It is my own fault,” etc., etc. ourfeyrac, to whom he confided nothing,—it was his nature,—but who made some ittle guess at everything,—that was his nature,—had begun by congratulating him n being in love, though he was amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this elancholy state, he ended by saying to him: “I see that you have been simply an nimal. Here, come to the Chaumière.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.1.4#Once, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowed himself o be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and Grantaire, hoping, hat a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there. Of course he did not see he one he sought.—“But this is the place, all the same, where all lost women re found,” grumbled Grantaire in an aside. Marius left his friends at the ball nd returned home on foot, alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad nd troubled eyes, stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with inging creatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close to him, s he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut-trees, long the road, in order to refresh his head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.1.5#He took to living more and more alone, utterly overwhelmed, wholly given up o his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap, eeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.1.6#On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a singular ffect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard des nvalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor, hich allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair. Marius was struck with the eauty of this white hair, and scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and s though absorbed in painful meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he ecognized M. Leblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the ap permitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But why hese workingman’s clothes? What was the meaning of this? What signified that isguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself, his first mpulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did not hold at last the lue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see the man near at hand, and lear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to him too late, the man was no onger there. He had turned into some little side street, and Marius could not ind him. This encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced. After all,” he said to himself, “it was probably only a resemblance.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.1#Marius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any one here.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.2#At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in the ouse, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once paid, without, oreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother, or daughters. The other odgers had moved away or had died, or had been turned out in default of ayment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.3#One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in the fternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemas day whose reacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks’ cold spell, inspired Mathieu aensberg with these two lines, which have with justice remained classic:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.6#He had just crossed his threshold, where Ma’am Bougon was sweeping at the oment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.7#“What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothing in he world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for nothing, the rouble of the world!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.8#Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order to reach he Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.9#All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round, and aw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other a little horter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, in terror, and with the ppearance of fleeing; they had been coming to meet him, had not seen him, and ad jostled him as they passed. Through the twilight, Marius could distinguish heir livid faces, their wild heads, their dishevelled hair, their hideous onnets, their ragged petticoats, and their bare feet. They were talking as they an. The taller said in a very low voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.10#“The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle.” The ther answered: “I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.11#Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or the olice had come near apprehending these two children, and that the latter had scaped.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.12#They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and there reated, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot, then isappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.13#Marius had halted for a moment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.14#He was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little grayish ackage lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked it up. It was a ort of envelope which appeared to contain papers.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.16#He retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflected that hey must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, and went off to ine.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.18#“Poor mothers!” he thought. “There is one thing sadder than to see one’s hildren die; it is to see them leading an evil life.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.19#Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his houghts, and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations. He fell o thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air nd the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees of Luxembourg.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.2.20#“How gloomy my life has become!” he said to himself. “Young girls are lways appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they are houls.”

He had forgotten it. He thought that it would be well to pen it, and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young irls, if it really belonged to them, and, in any case, the information ecessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.2#He opened the envelope.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.7#Marius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the information hich he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open, it was probable that t could be read without impropriety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.8#It was conceived as follows:—

Turn your Christian spirit and cast a look of compassion n this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause f legitimacy, who has given with his blood, consecrated his fortune, vverything, to defend that cause, and to-day finds himself in the greatest issery.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.12#Madame la Comtesse: It is an unhappy mother of a family of six children he last of which is only eight months old. I sick since my last confinement, bandoned by my husband five months ago, haveing no resources in the world the ost frightful indigance.

The subject is historical, nd the action takes place in Auvergne in the time of the Empire; the style, I hink, is natural, laconic, and may have some merit. There are couplets to be ung in four places. The comic, the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a ariety of characters, and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the ntrigue which proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations, in he midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.17#My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates he man of our century, that is to say, the fashion, that capritious and bizarre eathervane which changes at almost every new wind.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.21#Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: _To the enevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-haut-Pas_. It contained he following lines:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.28#Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alvarès, istress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; but the ingular thing about these letters was, that all four were written by the same and.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.30#Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the oarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco was the ame, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the style, the same rthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity, and the an of letters Genflot was no more exempt from them than the Spanish aptain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.31#It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it not een a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification. Marius was oo melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to lend himself to a ame which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him. It eemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man’s buff etween the four letters, and that they were making sport of him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.32#Nothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two young irls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they were evidently apers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope, flung the whole into corner and went to bed. About seven o’clock in the morning, he had just risen nd breakfasted, and was trying to settle down to work, when there came a soft nock at his door.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.33#As he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally, though ery rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even when absent he left is key in the lock. “You will be robbed,” said Ma’am Bougon. “Of what?” said arius. The truth is, however, that he had, one day, been robbed of an old pair f boots, to the great triumph of Ma’am Bougon.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.3.40#It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old man, oughened with brandy and liquor.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.head#CHAPTER IV—A ROSE IN MISERY
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.1#A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window of he garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the door, and lluminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated, slender reature; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and hivering nakedness. Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a string, her ointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, arth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing eeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed er youth, and the look of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with ifteen; one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause hose to shudder whom they do not cause to weep.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.2#Marius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, who as almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.3#The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had not come nto the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must even have been retty. The grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous, premature ecrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains of beauty were dying away in hat face of sixteen, like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous louds at dawn on a winter’s day.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.4#That face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he remembered having een it somewhere.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.8#She called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the person hom she wanted; but who was this girl? How did she know his name?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.9#Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She entered esolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed, at the hole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holes in her petticoat ermitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees. She was shivering.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.10#She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.11#Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which ealed it was still moist. The message could not have come from a distance. He ead:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.16#This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which ad occupied Marius’ thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like a andle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.17#This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the same riting, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the same odor of obacco.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.18#There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single igner. The Spanish Captain Don Alvarès, the unhappy Mistress Balizard, the ramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four named Jondrette, f, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.19#Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had, s we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his xtremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there he eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in he corridor or on the stairs; but they were mere forms to him; he had paid so ittle heed to them, that, on the preceding evening, he had jostled the ondrette girls on the boulevard, without recognizing them, for it had evidently een they, and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered is room had awakened in him, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection f having met her elsewhere.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.20#Now he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor Jondrette, n his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of enevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that he wrote under feigned ames to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate, letters which is daughters delivered at their risk and peril, for this father had come to uch a pass, that he risked his daughters; he was playing a game with fate, and e used them as the stake. Marius understood that probably, judging from their light on the evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror nd from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate creatures ere plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the result of the whole as, in the midst of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable eings who were neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent onsters produced by misery.

Souls hich blossomed out yesterday, and are faded to-day, like those flowers let fall n the streets, which are soiled with every sort of mire, while waiting for some heel to crush them. Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished aze on her, the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the udacity of a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself as to her akedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn, fell almost to er waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the toilet articles which tood on the commode, she handled Marius’ clothes, she rummaged about to see hat there was in the corners.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.23#And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone, rolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.24#An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptible eneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.25#Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room, nd, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the aylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other conditions of ducation and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this young girl might have urned out sweet and charming. Never, even among animals, does the creature born o be a dove change into an osprey. That is only to be seen among men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.26#Marius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.27#She approached the table.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.29#A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressed the appiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no human creature is nsensible:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.43#“Bah!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.48#Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.50#And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made her mile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on his shoulder: You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I meet you here on the taircase, and then I often see you going to a person named Father Mabeuf who ives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when I have been strolling in hat quarter. It is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.4.51#She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it very eep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her ips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.1#Marius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even in istress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. True misery he ad but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just passed before his yes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing; the isery of woman is what he must see; he who has seen only the misery of woman as seen nothing; he must see the misery of the child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.2#When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last esources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surround him! ork, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail him simultaneously. The ight of day seems extinguished without, the moral light within; in these hadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child, and bends them iolently to ignominy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.3#Then all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragile artitions which all open on either vice or crime.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.4#Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the heart, irginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated in sinister wise y that fumbling which seeks resources, which encounters opprobrium, and which ccommodates itself to it. Fathers, mothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, omen, daughters, adhere and become incorporated, almost like a mineral ormation, in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, nfamies, and innocences. They crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. hey exchange woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they re! How cold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further rom the sun than ours.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.5#This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad hadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.6#Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of reverie and assion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that ay. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement, which any one ould have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done better than that. What! nly a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the ark outside the pale of the rest of the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, e was, in some sort, the last link of the human race which they touched, he eard them live, or rather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no eed to them! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side f the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even lend an ar! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen to them, his houghts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves n the air, to follies; and all the while, human creatures, his brothers in esus Christ, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! He ven formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had ad another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary nd charitable man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their ignals of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken old of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no doubt, ery vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming degraded are are; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and re confounded in a single word, a fatal word, _the miserable_; whose fault is his? And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as he fall is great?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.7#While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on which arius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and scolded himself ore than he deserved, he stared at the wall which separated him from the ondrettes, as though he were able to make his gaze, full of pity, penetrate hat partition and warm these wretched people. The wall was a thin layer of laster upheld by lathes and beams, and, as the reader had just learned, it llowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as reamy as Marius could have failed to perceive this long before. There was no aper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of arius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined he partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes reverie examines, observes, and crutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had just perceived, ear the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from the pace between three lathes. The plaster which should have filled this cavity was issing, and by mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this perture into the Jondrettes’ attic. Commiseration has, and should have, its uriosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze t misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.27
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.8#“Let us get some little idea of what these people are like,” thought arius, “and in what condition they are.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.5.9#He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.head#CHAPTER VI—THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.1#Cities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wicked and ormidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only, in cities, hat which thus conceals itself is ferocious, unclean, and petty, that is to ay, ugly; in forests, that which conceals itself is ferocious, savage, and rand, that is to say, beautiful. Taking one lair with another, the beast’s is referable to the man’s. Caverns are better than hovels.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.2#What Marius now beheld was a hovel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.3#Marius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his poverty as noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now rested was bject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only furniture consisted of straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits of crockery, and in two of the orners, two indescribable pallets; all the light was furnished by a dormer indow of four panes, draped with spiders’ webs. Through this aperture there enetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a hantom. The walls had a leprous aspect, and were covered with seams and scars, ike a visage disfigured by some horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exuded rom them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be istinguished upon them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.4#The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement; this ne was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directly on the ntique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under the long-continued ressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, where the dirt seemed to be fairly ncrusted, and which possessed but one virginity, that of the broom, were apriciously grouped constellations of old shoes, socks, and repulsive rags; owever, this room had a fireplace, so it was let for forty francs a year. There as every sort of thing in that fireplace, a brazier, a pot, broken boards, rags uspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire. Two brands ere smouldering there in a melancholy way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.5#One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, that it as large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower sides of oofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable nooks where it eemed as though spiders as big as one’s fist, wood-lice as large as one’s foot, nd perhaps even—who knows?—some monstrous human beings, must be hiding.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.6#One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One end of ach touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the aperture hrough which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame was uspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large letters, was the nscription: THE DREAM. This represented a sleeping woman, and a child, also sleep, the child on the woman’s lap, an eagle in a cloud, with a crown in his eak, and the woman thrusting the crown away from the child’s head, without waking the latter; in the background, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very lue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.8#Beneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer than it was road, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall. It ad the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall, of a frame robably showing a daub on the other side, of some pier-glass detached from a all and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.9#Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sat a man bout sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a cunning, cruel, nd uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.6.14#On the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume, nd the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed a romance. n the cover sprawled the following title, printed in large capitals: GOD; THE ING; HONOR AND THE LADIES; BY DUCRAY DUMINIL, 1814.

The garret, the cellar, the lowly ditch where certain ndigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice, is not exactly he sepulchre, but only its antechamber; but, as the wealthy display their reatest magnificence at the entrance of their palaces, it seems that death, hich stands directly side by side with them, places its greatest miseries in hat vestibule.

This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, judging from the mount of love within her; but probably, in the daily and reciprocal reproaches f the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group, this had become xtinct. There no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of ffection for her husband. Nevertheless, caressing appellations had survived, as s often the case.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.7.53#The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, and struck pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loud clatter.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.9.9#It was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the very oment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of a person who s seeking to recall a name:—

During her entire stay there, he had lived that life of cstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a ingle point. He contemplated, not that girl, but that light which wore a satin elisse and a velvet bonnet. The star Sirius might have entered the room, and he ould not have been any more dazzled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.2#While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the lothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the little njured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought to catch her ords. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form, her walk, he did not now the sound of her voice. He had once fancied that he had caught a few words t the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sure of the fact. He would have iven ten years of his life to hear it, in order that he might bear away in his oul a little of that music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable xclamations and trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine rath to Marius’ ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believe hat it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile reatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird n the midst of toads.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.3#When she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, to ling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where she lived, not to ose her again, at least, after having so miraculously re-discovered her. He eaped down from the commode and seized his hat. As he laid his hand on the lock f the door, and was on the point of opening it, a sudden reflection caused him o pause. The corridor was long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, . Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in he corridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius, in hat house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to escape from im again, and this time it would be final. What was he to do? Should he wait a ittle? But while he was waiting, the carriage might drive off. Marius was erplexed. At last he accepted the risk and quitted his room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.4#There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was no ne on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the boulevard in ime to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, on its way ack to Paris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.5#Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of the oulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending the Rue ouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there was no means of vertaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and besides, the people in the arriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit f a fiacre, and the father would recognize him. At that moment, wonderful and nprecedented good luck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the oulevard. There was but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow he fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.6#Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.7#“By the hour?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.8#Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute of uttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.9#The driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, rubbing is forefinger gently with his thumb.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.10#“What is it?” said Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.11#“Pay in advance,” said the coachman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.12#Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.13#“How much?” he demanded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.14#“Forty sous.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.15#“I will pay on my return.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.16#The driver’s only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whip p his horse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.17#Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For the ack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness, his love! He ad seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflected bitterly, and it must be onfessed, with profound regret, on the five francs which he had bestowed, that ery morning, on that miserable girl. If he had had those five francs, he would ave been saved, he would have been born again, he would have emerged from the imbo and darkness, he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen, rom his widowed state; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny o that beautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes and had roken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in despair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.18#He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in the vening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully, o that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in his contemplation, it is oubtful whether he had heard this.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.19#As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the ther side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De la arrière-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the “philanthropist’s” great-coat, ngaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have een dubbed by common consent, _prowlers of the barriers_; people of equivocal ace, of suspicious monologues, who present the air of having evil minds, and ho generally sleep in the daytime, which suggests the supposition that they ork by night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.20#These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the snow hich was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman would surely ave observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.10.21#Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain from aying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette was alking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom ourfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. his man’s name the reader has learned in the preceding book. This Panchaud, lias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured later on in many criminal trials, nd became a notorious rascal. He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day e exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the ead of a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at ightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was discussed t La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison, precisely at he spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, in broad aylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, ANCHAUD, audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during ne of his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, ut he had not as yet made a serious beginning.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.1#Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment when e was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder Jondrette girl ollowing him through the corridor. The very sight of this girl was odious to im; it was she who had his five francs, it was too late to demand them back, he cab was no longer there, the fiacre was far away. Moreover, she would not ave given them back. As for questioning her about the residence of the persons ho had just been there, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, ince the letter signed Fabantou had been addressed “to the benevolent gentleman f the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.2#Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.3#It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door alf open.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.4#“What is it?” he asked, “who is there?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.5#It was the Jondrette girl.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.6#“Is it you?” resumed Marius almost harshly, “still you! What do you want ith me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.7#She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer had he air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did not nter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius could see her hrough the half-open door.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.8#“Come now, will you answer?” cried Marius. “What do you want with me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.9#She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker aguely, and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.10#“Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.11#“With me!” said Marius.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.17#“Let me alone!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.18#Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.19#“Stop,” said she, “you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you ere kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat, now tell e what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want you to be rieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service? Employ me. I do not sk for your secrets, you need not tell them to me, but I may be of use, evertheless. I may be able to help you, since I help my father. When it is ecessary to carry letters, to go to houses, to inquire from door to door, to ind out an address, to follow any one, I am of service. Well, you may assuredly ell me what is the matter with you, and I will go and speak to the persons; ometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let hem understand matters, and everything comes right. Make use of me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.20#An idea flashed across Marius’ mind. What branch does one disdain when one eels that one is falling?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.21#He drew near to the Jondrette girl.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.22#“Listen—” he said to her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.23#She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.31#“Is that what you want?” she demanded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.32#“Yes.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.36#This _them_ which had turned into _her_ had something indescribably ignificant and bitter about it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.38#“You shall have the beautiful lady’s address.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.39#There was still a shade in the words “the beautiful lady” which troubled arius. He resumed:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.41#She gazed fixedly at him.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.48#Marius found himself alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.49#He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed, bsorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to vertigo. ll that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of the angel, her isappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleam of hope floating n an immense despair,—this was what filled his brain confusedly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.50#All at once he was violently aroused from his reverie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.51#He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which were raught with a strange interest for him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.52#“I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.53#Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? The ather of “his Ursule”? What! Did Jondrette know him?

Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who hat young girl was? Who her father was? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped hem on the point of being dispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! eavens!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.11.54#He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post near he little peep-hole in the partition wall.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.1#Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic by ature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in him ympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for irritation, ut had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had the kindliness of a rahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity upon a toad, but he crushed a iper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed, t was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.2#“These wretches must be stamped upon,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.3#Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been lucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense, if nything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and he man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette was acquainted with hem. Athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered, the only thing of hich he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of reparation, a dark but terrible trap; that both of them were incurring great anger, she probably, her father certainly; that they must be saved; that the ideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders roken.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.4#He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old heet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap of ron.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.5#He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to ake the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and in the orror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced a sort of joy t the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the ne whom he loved.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.6#But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not know heir address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes, and had then lunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should he wait for M. eblanc at the door that evening at six o’clock, at the moment of his arrival, nd warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch, he spot was lonely, they were stronger than he, they would devise means to eize him or to get him away, and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would e lost. One o’clock had just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius ad five hours before him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.7#There was but one thing to be done.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.8#He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck, took is hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he had been reading on moss with bare feet.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.11#He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall hich a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on a waste pace, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupied condition, and he snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once he heard voices talking ery close by. He turned his head, the street was deserted, there was not a soul n it, it was broad daylight, and yet he distinctly heard voices.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.12#It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.13#There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against he wall, talking together in subdued tones.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.14#These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in a louse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man had on a ez, the other’s head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his hair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.15#By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.16#The hairy one jogged the other man’s elbow and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.20#“It’s as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the orst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.21#The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his ez:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.22#“That’s a real thing. You can’t go against such things.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.23#“I tell you that the affair can’t go wrong,” resumed the long-haired man. Father What’s-his-name’s team will be already harnessed.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.24#Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding vening at the Gaîté Theatre.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.25#Marius went his way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.26#It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely idden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear some elation to Jondrette’s abominable projects. That must be _the affair_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.27#He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at the irst shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.30#As he passed a baker’s shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it, oreseeing that he should not dine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.13.31#On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he ot given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he would have ollowed M.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.4#The clerk introduced him into the commissary’s office. There stood a tall an behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with both hands he tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face was square, with a hin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was nough to turn your pockets inside out. Of that glance it might have been well aid, not that it penetrated, but that it searched.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.5#This man’s air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than ondrette’s; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the wolf.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.13#This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the ame time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure to him: hat a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight, was to be nveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining he den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the artition; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; hat there would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among thers a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette’s aughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning the threatened an, since he did not even know his name; and that, finally, all this was to be arried out at six o’clock that evening, at the most deserted point of the oulevard de l’Hôpital, in house No. 50-52.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.14#At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said oldly:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.17#The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed the eel of his boot at the door of the stove:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.18#“Apparently.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.14.19#He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so much s his cravat:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.17#“He’s following a man!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.18#A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be istinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about twenty aces in advance of Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.19#This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large or him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with ud.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.22#“He?” retorted Courfeyrac, “he’s a poet. Poets are very fond of wearing he trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of rance.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.23#“Let’s see where Marius will go,” said Bossuet; “let’s see where the man s going, let’s follow them, hey?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.24#“Bossuet!” exclaimed Courfeyrac, “eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigious rute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.25#They retraced their steps.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.26#Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard, and as spying on his proceedings.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.27#Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was already eld by a glance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.28#He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most errible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter of an our, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an ironmonger’s shop, hich then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes ater Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold hisel with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At he top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to he Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at the very orner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, and did not ollow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the icinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded an conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was following him, id not see him, then sprang across the wall and disappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.29#The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an x-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who still kept a few ld single-seated berlins under his sheds.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.30#Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette’s absence to eturn home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma’am Bougon when she et out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of locking the door, which was lways closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to the inspector of police; it as important, therefore, that he should make haste.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.31#Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in the mmensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun, and that as the moon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.32#It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpêtrière.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.33#Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still open hen he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall of he corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader will remember, was ordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, for the moment, empty and o let. Ma’am Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open. As he assed one of these attics, Marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell he motionless heads of four men, vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, alling through a dormer window.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.15.34#Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. He ucceeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any oise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma’am Bougon take her eparture, locking the door of the house behind her.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.1#Marius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past five ’clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. He heard he beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark. He hought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark,—crime dvancing on one side, justice coming up on the other. He was not afraid, but he ould not think without a shudder of what was about to take place. As is the ase with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the ntire day produced upon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade imself that he was not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels f the steel pistols in his trousers pockets.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.2#It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly rom the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection of the snow hich had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.3#There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wall hining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.4#It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However, here was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving there, ot a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial and profound, and had t not been for that light, he might have thought himself next door to a epulchre.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.5#Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.6#Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges; a eavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; the latch of he hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.7#Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret. Only, t had been silent in the master’s absence, like wolf whelps in the absence of he wolf.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.18#“Yes,” said the mother. “I got three large potatoes and some salt. I took dvantage of the fire to cook them.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.24#Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron tensil, and Jondrette continued:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.33#“Yes,” said the mother.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.41#“P’pa,” cried a voice, “he is not in here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.42#He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.44#“No,” replied the girl, “but as his key is in the door, he must be ut.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.45#The father exclaimed:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.47#The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle n her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still more repulsive n this light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.48#She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable moment f anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and it was hither that she was directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoe and ooked at herself in it. In the neighboring room, the sound of iron articles eing moved was audible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.49#She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the irror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.53#“How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.54#She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it, crutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.55#“Well!” cried her father, “what are you about there?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.56#“I am looking under the bed and the furniture,” she replied, continuing to rrange her hair; “there’s no one here.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.61#She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door ehind her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.62#A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls’ bare eet in the corridor, and Jondrette’s voice shouting to them:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.63#“Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the corner f the Rue du Petit-Banquier.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.67#They ran downstairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door s it banged to announced that they were outside.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.16.68#There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and probably, lso, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a glimpse in the wilight, behind the door of the unused attic.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.head#CHAPTER XVII—THE USE MADE OF MARIUS’ FIVE-FRANC PIECE
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.1#Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post t his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age, he had eached the hole in the partition.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.2#He looked.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.3#The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and arius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed. A candle as burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that was not what eally lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely illuminated, as it were, by he reflection from a rather large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, nd filled with burning charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman hat morning. The charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame lickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased y Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the razier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as though prepared for some efinite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the one a heap of ld iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have caused the mind of a erson who knew nothing of what was in preparation, to waver between a very inister and a very simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge han a mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a emon than of a smith.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.4#The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was elting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An old ark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood on the himney-piece.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.5#The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct rands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.6#The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its whiteness nto the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit of Marius, who was reamy even in the moment of action, it was like a thought of heaven mingled ith the misshapen reveries of earth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.7#A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to issipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the razier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.8#The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the orbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and ombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most retired chamber in he most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in Paris. If the system f ambush and traps had not already existed, they would have been invented here.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.9#The whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms eparated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed opened n waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.10#Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair, and as engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.11#If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who laugh n every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell n the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the ats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of Charles X., an immense tartan hawl over her knitted petticoat, and the man’s shoes which her daughter had corned in the morning. It was this toilette which had extracted from Jondrette he exclamation: “Good! You have dressed up. You have done well. You must nspire confidence!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.12#As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too arge for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costume continued to resent that contrast of coat and trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet n Courfeyrac’s eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.13#All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.14#“By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in a arriage. Light the lantern, take it and go downstairs. You will stand behind he lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop, you will open he door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the staircase and the orridor, and when he enters here, you will go downstairs again as speedily as ossible, you will pay the coachman, and dismiss the fiacre.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.15#“And the money?” inquired the woman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.16#Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.17#“What’s this?” she exclaimed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.18#Jondrette replied with dignity:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.19#“That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.20#And he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.21#“Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.22#“What for?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.23#“To sit on.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.24#Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild nswer from Jondrette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.25#“Pardieu! I’ll go and get one of our neighbor’s.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.26#And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went out nto the corridor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.27#Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach his ed, and conceal himself beneath it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.28#“Take the candle,” cried Jondrette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.29#“No,” said she, “it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry. here is moonlight.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.30#Marius heard Mother Jondrette’s heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the ark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with orror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.31#The Jondrette entered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.32#The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two locks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall gainst which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.33#Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two chairs, he only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the door fall eavily to behind her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.34#She re-entered the lair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.35#“Here are the two chairs.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.37#She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.38#He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the chisel n the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the hafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, and bent down s though to examine something. Marius then recognized the fact, that what he ad taken for a shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder, with wooden ungs and two hooks with which to attach it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.39#This ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which were ingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in the ondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither in the fternoon, during Marius’ absence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.40#“Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker,” thought Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.41#Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would have ecognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker, certain nstruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others which will cut or lice, the two families of tools which burglars call _cadets_ and fauchants_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.42#The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The brazier eing concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle; the mallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large hadow. There was something indescribably calm, threatening, and hideous about his chamber. One felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something errible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.17.43#Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of preoccupation, nd had again seated himself. The candle brought out the fierce and the fine ngles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the ight hand, as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward onologue. In the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to imself, he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen nife which was concealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. hat done, he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.5#He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.6#Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making a orrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern lluminated from below.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.9#M. Leblanc made his appearance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.10#He wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.16#She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering M. eblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in his ear:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.17#“‘Tis done.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.18#The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep that he arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not now hear its eparture.

Leblanc tranquil, ondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one orner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, ot missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.18.22#However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. He lasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. “I shall be able to top that wretch whenever I please,” he thought.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.3#“Bad,” replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, “very bad, y worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to have her hurt ressed. You will see them presently; they will be back immediately.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.4#“Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better,” went on M. Leblanc, casting his yes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stood between him nd the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazed at him in an ttitude of menace and almost of combat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.5#“She is dying,” said Jondrette. “But what do you expect, sir! She has so uch courage, that woman has! She’s not a woman, she’s an ox.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.8#“Jondrette!” said M. Leblanc, “I thought your name was Fabantou?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.9#“Fabantou, alias Jondrette!” replied the husband hurriedly. “An artistic obriquet!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.10#And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did ot catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.11#“Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What ould there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my espectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will, no work! don’t know how the government arranges that, but, on my word of honor, sir, I m not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.30 I don’t wish them any evil, but if were the ministers, on my most sacred word, things would be different.

There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! ne thing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willing o part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.12#While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which detracted othing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy, Marius aised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had ot seen before. A man had just entered, so softly that the door had not been eard to turn on its hinges. This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, orn, spotted, cut and gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, ooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, nd his face smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest ed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.13#That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M. eblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not refrain rom a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.14#“Ah! I see!” exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air of omplaisance, “you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith, but it its me!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.15#“Who is that man?” said M. Leblanc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.16#“Him?” ejaculated Jondrette, “he’s a neighbor of mine. Don’t pay any ttention to him.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.17#The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories of hemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the workmen ight have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc’s whole person was expressive f candid and intrepid confidence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.18#He went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.19#“Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.20#“I was telling you, sir, and dear protector,” replied Jondrette placing is elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and tender yes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, “I was telling you, that I ave a picture to sell.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.21#A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and eated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.22#Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or ampblack.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.23#Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been ble to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.24#“Don’t mind them,” said Jondrette, “they are people who belong in the ouse. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable picture. ut stop, sir, take a look at it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.25#He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we ave already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported against he wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, and which the andle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out of it, as Jondrette tood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarse daub, and a sort of rincipal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and creen paintings.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.26#“What is that?” asked M. Leblanc.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.27#Jondrette exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.28#“A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am as uch attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls souvenirs to me! But have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am so wretched that I will art with it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.29#Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness, M. eblanc’s glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the icture.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.30#There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the oor-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared with lack. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with closed eyes, nd it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was old; his white hair ontrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect. The other two eemed to be young; one wore a beard, the other wore his hair long. None of them ad on shoes; those who did not wear socks were barefooted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.31#Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc’s eye was fixed on these men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.32#“They are friends. They are neighbors,” said he. “Their faces are black ecause they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don’t trouble yourself bout them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on my misery. I will ot ask you much for it. How much do you think it is worth?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.33#“Well,” said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with the anner of a man who is on his guard, “it is some signboard for a tavern, and is orth about three francs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.34#Jondrette replied sweetly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.35#“Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a thousand rowns.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.36#M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid lance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the indow, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on the side next he door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem to be looking on.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.37#Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague an ye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have supposed that hat he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.38#“If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,” said Jondrette, “I hall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but to throw yself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my two girls taught he middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes for New Year’s gifts! ell! A table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is equired, then a special stove is needed, a pot with three compartments for the ifferent degrees of strength of the paste, according as it is to be used for ood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust t, a hammer to nail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all?

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.39#As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing him. . Leblanc’s eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette’s eye was fixed on the oor. Marius’ eager attention was transferred from one to the other. M. Leblanc eemed to be asking himself: “Is this man an idiot?” Jondrette repeated two or hree distinct times, with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and upplicating order: “There is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the iver! I went down three steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other ay for that purpose.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.19.40#All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little man rew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc and cried in voice of thunder: “That has nothing to do with the question! Do you know e?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.head#CHAPTER XX—THE TRAP
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.1#The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of hree men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black paper. The irst was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the second, who was a sort f colossus, carried, by the middle of the handle, with the blade downward, a utcher’s pole-axe for slaughtering cattle. The third, a man with thick-set houlders, not so slender as the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen rom the door of some prison.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.2#It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been aiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel, he thin one.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.18#M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in the en, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his head, directed n turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved on his neck with an stonished and attentive slowness, but there was nothing in his air which esembled fear. He had improvised an intrenchment out of the table; and the man, ho but an instant previously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old an, had suddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the ack of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.19#This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a anger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous as they re kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we love is never a tranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.20#Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: “They are chimney-builders,” ad armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one with a heavy pair of shears, he second with weighing-tongs, the third with a hammer, and had placed hemselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable. The old man had emained on the bed, and had merely opened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had eated herself beside him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.21#Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention ould arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the direction f the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.22#Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel, urned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying it with hat low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.23#“So you do not recognize me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.24#M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.25#“No.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.26#Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle, rossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M. Leblanc’s alm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M. Leblanc to etreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite, he xclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.27#“My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is Thénardier. am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand? Thénardier! Now do you now me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.28#An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc’s brow, and he replied ith a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level, with his ccustomed placidity:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.29#“No more than before.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.30#Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment hrough the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid, hunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: “My name is Thénardier,” arius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against the wall, as though he elt the cold of a steel blade through his heart. Then his right arm, all ready o discharge the signal shot, dropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette epeated, “Thénardier, do you understand?” Marius’s faltering fingers had come ear letting the pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not oved M. Leblanc, but he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thénardier, with hich M. Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader ecall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart, nscribed in his father’s testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in he depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: “A certain Thénardier saved y life. If my son encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies in his ower.” That name, it will be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul; he ingled it with the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that hénardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly ought! He had found him at last, and how? His father’s saviour was a ruffian! hat man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, was a monster! hat liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose cope Marius did not, as yet, clearly comprehend, but which resembled an ssassination! And against whom, great God! what a fatality! What a bitter ockery of fate! His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to o all the good in his power to this Thénardier, and for four years Marius had herished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father’s, and at the oment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very act of rime by justice, destiny cried to him: “This is Thénardier!” He could at last epay this man for his father’s life, saved amid a hail-storm of grape-shot on he heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it with the scaffold! He had sworn to imself that if ever he found that Thénardier, he would address him only by hrowing himself at his feet; and now he actually had found him, but it was only o deliver him over to the executioner! His father said to him: “Succor hénardier!” And he replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing hénardier! He was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of hat man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on he Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whom he ad entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have so long worn on is breast his father’s last commands, written in his own hand, only to act in o horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look on that trap and ot prevent it! Condemn the victim and to spare the assassin! Could one be held o any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had herished for the last four years were pierced through and through, as it were, y this unforeseen blow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.31#He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he held n his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes. If he ired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thénardier lost; if he did not fire, . Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who knows? Thénardier would escape. Should e dash down the one or allow the other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either ase.

Be false to the most imperious ouvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty, to the ost venerated text! Should he ignore his father’s testament, or allow the erpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him that he heard “his rsule” supplicating for her father and on the other, the colonel commending hénardier to his care. He felt that he was going mad. His knees gave way eneath him. And he had not even the time for deliberation, so great was the ury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe. It as like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master, and which was ow sweeping him away. He was on the verge of swooning.

His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble, ruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last, harass what it as feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be ble to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is eginning to rend a sick bull, so nearly dead that he can no longer defend imself, but sufficiently alive to suffer still.

His perplexity was redoubled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.55#Moreover, there was in all these words of Thénardier, in his accent, in is gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there was, in this xplosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in that mixture of raggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness, of rage and folly, in that haos of real griefs and false sentiments, in that immodesty of a malicious man asting the voluptuous delights of violence, in that shameless nudity of a epulsive soul, in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all atreds, something which was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the ruth.

It was the group composed of Pontmercy nd Thénardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the colonel rescued. Marius was like a runken man; this picture restored his father to life in some sort; it was no onger the signboard of the wine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a omb had yawned, a phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in is temples, he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, aguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him that he misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.

You have not made an outcry; that is because you on’t care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do.

Two undred thousand francs—it’s surely worth all that. This trifle once out of your ocket, I guarantee you that that’s the end of the matter, and that you have no urther demands to fear. You will say to me: ‘But I haven’t two hundred thousand rancs about me.’ Oh! I’m not extortionate. I don’t demand that. I only ask one hing of you.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.203#Who was this “little one” whom Thénardier had called the Lark? Was she is “Ursule”? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word, “the ark,” and had replied in the most natural manner in the world: “I do not know hat you mean.” On the other hand, the two letters U.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.204#A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which he as observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood, almost incapable f movement or reflection, as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed t such close quarters.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.206#Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thénardier seemed to be bsorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Marius fancied hat at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a faint, dull oise in the direction of the prisoner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.207#All at once, Thénardier addressed the prisoner:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.209#These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius trained his ears.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.210#“My wife will be back shortly, don’t get impatient.

If you have me arrested, my omrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that’s all.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.213#He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thénardier esumed:—

But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, nonetheless, e out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected on Thénardier’s words, f which he perceived the bloody significance: “If you have me arrested, my omrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.240#The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house ventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut and orked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the police made heir descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels of industry, which re engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the hadows, marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape. These ideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers’ work what the etaphors of slang are to poetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, ust as there are Villons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to eliverance finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common ooden-handled knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these lates without affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of he sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed ogether and unscrewed at will; it is a box. In this box he hides a atch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sized chains nd bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou; ot at all, he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, during he subsequent search of the police, was found under the bed near the window. hey also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.261#“Cut his throat.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.262#“That’s it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.263#It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.264#Thénardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and took ut the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol. Unprecedented erplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience, the one njoining him to respect his father’s testament, the other crying to him to escue the prisoner. These two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle hich tormented him to agony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope hat he should find some means of reconciling these two duties, but nothing ithin the limits of possibility had presented itself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.265#However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been reached; hénardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.266#Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of espair. All at once a shudder ran through him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.267#At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon lluminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this paper he ead the following line written that very morning, in large letters, by the ldest of the Thénardier girls:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.268#“THE BOBBIES ARE HERE.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.269#An idea, a flash, crossed Marius’ mind; this was the expedient of which e was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing im, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.270#He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet of aper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paper round t, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.271#It was high time. Thénardier had conquered his last fears or his last cruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.272#“Something is falling!” cried the Thénardier woman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.273#“What is it?” asked her husband.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.274#The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed it o her husband.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.275#“Where did this come from?” demanded Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.276#“Pardie!” ejaculated his wife, “where do you suppose it came from? hrough the window, of course.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.277#“I saw it pass,” said Bigrenaille.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.278#Thénardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the andle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.279#“It’s in Éponine’s handwriting. The devil!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.280#He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the ine written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.281#“Quick! The ladder! Let’s leave the bacon in the mousetrap and ecamp!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.282#“Without cutting that man’s throat?” asked, the Thénardier woman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.283#“We haven’t the time.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.284#“Through what?” resumed Bigrenaille.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.285#“Through the window,” replied Thénardier. “Since Ponine has thrown the tone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on that ide.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.286#The mask with the ventriloquist’s voice deposited his huge key on the loor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists, three imes rapidly without uttering a word.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.287#This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on oard ship.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.288#The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the twinkling f an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, and solidly fastened o the sill by the two iron hooks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.289#The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. He seemed o be dreaming or praying.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.290#As soon as the ladder was arranged, Thénardier cried:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.291#“Come! the bourgeoise first!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.292#And he rushed headlong to the window.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.293#But just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized him oughly by the collar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.294#“Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.296#“You are children,” said Thénardier, “we are losing time. The police are n our heels.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.297#“Well,” said the ruffians, “let’s draw lots to see who shall go down irst.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.298#Thénardier exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.299#“Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to waste ime, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! With written ames! Thrown into a hat!—”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.301#All wheeled round. It was Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.20.302#He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a mile.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.head#CHAPTER XXI—ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.1#At nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself etween the trees of the Rue de la Barrière-des-Gobelins which faced the Gorbeau ouse, on the other side of the boulevard. He had begun operations by opening his pockets,” and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with eeping a watch on the approaches to the den. But he had only “caged” Azelma. As or Éponine, she was not at her post, she had disappeared, and he had not been ble to seize her. Then Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting or the signal agreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly gitated him. At last, he had grown impatient, and, _sure that there was a nest here_, sure of being in “luck,” having recognized many of the ruffians who had ntered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the istol-shot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.2#It will be remembered that he had Marius’ pass-key.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.3#He had arrived just in the nick of time.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.4#The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had bandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than a second, hese seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in an attitude of efence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key, another with his bludgeon, he rest with shears, pincers, and hammers. Thénardier had his knife in his ist. The Thénardier woman snatched up an enormous paving-stone which lay in the ngle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.5#Javert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the room, ith arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its sheath.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.6#“Halt there,” said he. “You shall not go out by the window, you shall go hrough the door. It’s less unhealthy. There are seven of you, there are fifteen f us. Don’t let’s fall to collaring each other like men of Auvergne.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.7#Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his blouse, nd put it in Thénardier’s hand, whispering in the latter’s ear:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.8#“It’s Javert. I don’t dare fire at that man. Do you dare?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.9#“Parbleu!” replied Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.10#“Well, then, fire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.11#Thénardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.12#Javert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently at him and ontented himself with saying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.13#“Come now, don’t fire. You’ll miss fire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.14#Thénardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.15#“Didn’t I tell you so!” ejaculated Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.16#Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert’s feet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.17#“You’re the emperor of the fiends! I surrender.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.18#“And you?” Javert asked the rest of the ruffians.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.19#They replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.20#“So do we.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.21#Javert began again calmly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.22#“That’s right, that’s good, I said so, you are nice fellows.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.23#“I only ask one thing,” said Bigrenaille, “and that is, that I may not be enied tobacco while I am in confinement.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.24#“Granted,” said Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.25#And turning round and calling behind him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.26#“Come in now!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.27#A squad of policemen, sword in hand, and agents armed with bludgeons and udgels, rushed in at Javert’s summons. They pinioned the ruffians.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.28#This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the den ith shadows.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.29#“Handcuff them all!” shouted Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.30#“Come on!” cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of which no ne would ever have said: “It is a woman’s voice.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.31#The Thénardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the indow, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.32#The policemen and agents recoiled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.33#She had thrown off her shawl, but retained her bonnet; her husband, who as crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discarded shawl, and she as shielding him with her body, as she elevated the paving-stone above her head ith the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.34#“Beware!” she shouted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.35#All crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared in he middle of the garret.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.36#The Thénardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed hemselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.37#“The cowards!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.38#Javert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Thénardier was evouring with her eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.39#“Don’t come near me,” she cried, “or I’ll crush you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.40#“What a grenadier!” ejaculated Javert; “you’ve got a beard like a man, other, but I have claws like a woman.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.41#And he continued to advance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.42#The Thénardier, dishevelled and terrible, set her feet far apart, threw erself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert’s head. Javert ducked, he stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, knocked off a huge piece of lastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel, now luckily lmost empty, rested at Javert’s feet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.43#At the same moment, Javert reached the Thénardier couple. One of his big ands descended on the woman’s shoulder; the other on the husband’s head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.44#“The handcuffs!” he shouted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.45#The policemen trooped in in force, and in a few seconds Javert’s order had een executed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.46#The Thénardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, and at hose of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, and exclaimed, weeping:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.47#“My daughters!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.48#“They are in the jug,” said Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.49#In the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep ehind the door, and were shaking him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.50#He awoke, stammering:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.51#“Is it all over, Jondrette?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.52#“Yes,” replied Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.53#The six pinioned ruffians were standing, and still preserved their pectral mien; all three besmeared with black, all three masked.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.54#“Keep on your masks,” said Javert.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.55#And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a Potsdam arade, he said to the three “chimney-builders”:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.56#“Good day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day, Deuxmilliards!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.57#Then turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with the eat-axe:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.59#And to the man with the cudgel:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.61#And to the ventriloquist:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.62#“Your health, Claquesous.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.63#At that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians’ prisoner, who, ever since he entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had held his head own.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.64#“Untie the gentleman!” said Javert, “and let no one go out!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.65#That said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table, here the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew a stamped paper rom his pocket, and began to prepare his report.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.66#When he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never vary, e raised his eyes:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.67#“Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.68#The policemen glanced round them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.69#“Well,” said Javert, “where is he?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.70#The prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the father of rsule or the Lark, had disappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.71#The door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had found imself released from his bonds, and while Javert was drawing up his report, he ad taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, the darkness, and of a moment when he general attention was diverted from him, to dash out of the window.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:3.8.21.72#An agent sprang to the opening and looked out. He saw no one outside.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.1#1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the evolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of istory. These two years rise like two mountains midway between those which recede and those which follow them. They have a revolutionary grandeur. recipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses, the very assizes of ivilization, the solid group of superposed and adhering interests, the entury-old profiles of the ancient French formation, appear and disappear in hem every instant, athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of heories. These appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement nd resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be escried shining there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.2#This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be ufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even t the present day.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.3#We shall make the attempt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.4#The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to define, n which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and which are othing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.5#These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert hem to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but repose; it thirsts or but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition, to be small. Which is the ranslation of remaining tranquil. Of great events, great hazards, great dventures, great men, thank God, we have seen enough, we have them heaped igher than our heads. We would exchange Cæsar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the ing of Yvetot. “What a good little king was he!” We have marched since aybreak, we have reached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made ur first change with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third with onaparte; we are worn out. Each one demands a bed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.6#Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are ated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what? A shelter. hey have it. They take possession of peace, of tranquillity, of leisure; ehold, they are content. But, at the same time certain facts arise, compel ecognition, and knock at the door in their turn. These facts are the products f revolutions and wars, they are, they exist, they have the right to install hemselves in society, and they do install themselves therein; and most of the ime, facts are the stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do nothing but repare lodgings for principles.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.7#This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.8#At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demand uarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.9#This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this is hat France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.10#These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded. rinces “grant” them, but in reality, it is the force of things which gives hem. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts did not uspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain a glimpse of in 814.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.11#The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell, had he fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, and that what t had bestowed it could take back again; that the House of Bourbon possessed he right divine, that France possessed nothing, and that the political right onceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. was merely a branch of the right divine, as detached by the House of Bourbon and graciously given to the people until uch day as it should please the King to reassume it. Still, the House of ourbon should have felt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did ot come from it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.12#This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an ll-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of a trivial ord, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it looked glum. The people aw this.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.13#It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried away efore it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive that it had, tself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not perceive that it also ay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.14#It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken; it ormed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots of French ociety were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations. These obscure and ively roots constituted, not the right of a family, but the history of a eople. They were everywhere, except under the throne.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.15#The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in er history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny, and the ecessary base of her politics. She could get along without the Bourbons; she ad done without them for two and twenty years; there had been a break of ontinuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how should they have suspected t, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, and that ouis XVIII. was reigning at the battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of istory, had princes been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of ivine authority which facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension ere below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right rom on high.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.16#A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the uarantees “granted” in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them. Sad. A sad hing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests; what it termed our ncroachments were our rights.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.17#When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing itself ictorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that is to say, elieving itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on its plan of action, nd risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself up before the face of France, nd, elevating its voice, it contested the collective title and the individual ight of the nation to sovereignty, of the citizen to liberty. In other words, t denied to the nation that which made it a nation, and to the citizen that hich made him a citizen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.18#This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the rdinances of July. The Restoration fell.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.19#It fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to all orms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it alongside.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.20#Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion, hich had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur in peace, which had een wanting under the Empire. France free and strong had offered an encouraging pectacle to the other peoples of Europe. The Revolution had had the word under obespierre; the cannon had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis VIII. and Charles X. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The ind ceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, the pure ight of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, useful, and charming pectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great principles which are so old or the thinker, so new for the statesman, could be seen at work in perfect eace, on the public square; equality before the law, liberty of conscience, iberty of speech, liberty of the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to ll functions. Thus it proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of ivilization which broke in the hands of Providence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.21#The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but on he side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but without uthority; their descent into the night was not one of those solemn isappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; it was neither the pectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of Napoleon. They departed, hat is all. They laid down the crown, and retained no aureole. They were orthy, but they were not august. They lacked, in a certain measure, the majesty f their misfortune. Charles X. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a ound table to be cut over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious bout imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution addened devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their ace. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning with weapons, y a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession of so much force hat it did not go into a rage. It defended itself, restrained itself, restored hings to their places, the government to law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and hen halted! It took the old king Charles X. from beneath that dais which had heltered Louis XIV. and set him gently on the ground. It touched the royal ersonages only with sadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not a ew men, it was France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with er victory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice, efore the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du Vair after he day of the Barricades:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.22#“It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the great, nd to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an afflicted fortune to a lourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards their Prince in his adversity; ut as for me, the fortune of my Kings and especially of my afflicted Kings, ill always be venerable to me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.23#The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we have ust stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded out in the orizon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.24#The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout the ntire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the others urned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush, the princes of urope, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded and stupefied, and only pened them to threaten. A fright which can be comprehended, a wrath which can e pardoned. This strange revolution had hardly produced a shock; it had not ven paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy, and of hedding its blood. In the eyes of despotic governments, who are always nterested in having liberty calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed he fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was ttempted or plotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the ost trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, a ysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the ollaboration of some one who is working above man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.25#The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. A hing which is full of splendor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.26#Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of 830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of being iolent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.27#Right is the just and the true.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.28#The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The fact, ven when most necessary to all appearances, even when most thoroughly accepted y contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, and if it contain only too little f right, or none at all, is infallibly destined to become, in the course of ime, deformed, impure, perhaps, even monstrous. If one desires to learn at one low, to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance f centuries, let him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, or a demon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact. nd he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the fact of the ixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the presence of the moral dea of the nineteenth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.1.29#This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin of ociety. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with the humane eality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact and the fact into ight, that is the task of sages.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.head#CHAPTER II—BADLY SEWED
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.1#But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another. The evolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.2#As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to repare the shipwreck.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.3#The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of tatesmen; so that this word, _statesmen_, has ended by becoming somewhat of a lang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever there is nothing ut skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say “the skilful” amounts to aying “the mediocre.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.4#In the same way, to say “statesmen” is sometimes equivalent to saying traitors.” If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like the evolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature is indispensable. The ight, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, right once firmly fixed, the tate must be strengthened. Liberty once assured, attention must be directed to ower.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.5#Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they begin o be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, what is power? In he second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem to hear the murmured bjection, and they continue their manœuvres.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.6#According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask of ecessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people after a evolution, when this people forms part of a monarchical continent, is to rocure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they, peace, that is to say, time o dress our wounds, and to repair the house, can be had after a revolution. The ynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not always asy to procure a dynasty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.7#If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the first an of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king. You ave, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.8#But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty. here is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in a race, and the rinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.9#If we place ourselves at the point of view of the “statesmen,” after making ll allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the qualities of the ing which result from it? He may be and it is useful for him to be a evolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his own person in that evolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, that he should have either ompromised or distinguished himself therein, that he should have touched the xe or wielded the sword in it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.10#What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is to ay, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed, but by reason of deas accepted. It should be composed of past and be historic; be composed of uture and be sympathetic.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.11#All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with inding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutely insisted on inding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House of Orleans.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.12#Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which, ending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself. Each branch ay become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall bend down to the eople.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.13#Such is the theory of the skilful.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.14#Here, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success the ound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it lso, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment the curve of the ransition to the point of retarding progress, to dull that aurora, to denounce nd retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to cut all angles and nails, to wad riumph, to muffle up right, to envelop the giant-people in flannel, and to put t to bed very speedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put ercules on the treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event with the xpedient, to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out ith a potion, to take one’s precautions against too much success, to garnish he revolution with a shade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.15#1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.16#1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right. Now, ogic knows not the “almost,” absolutely as the sun knows not the candle.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.18#Why?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.19#Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction. esterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will be atiety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.20#The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after Charles .
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.21#The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of the ourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people. The ourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair is not a caste.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.22#But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march f the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.23#One is not a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is not ne of the divisions of the social order.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.24#Moreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which that part of he nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of 1830 was ot the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness, and which ontains a little shame; it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary orgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was the halt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.25#The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory ense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is to say, epose.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.26#The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on the lert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its uard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.27#The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of o-morrow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.28#It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.2.30#The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who should xpress this word Halt. An Although-Because. A composite individuality, ignifying revolution and signifying stability, in other terms, strengthening he present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.1#Revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly and hoose well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to the state f a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearly always retain ufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss.

Louis Philippe will be classed among he eminent men of his century, and would be ranked among the most illustrious overnors of history had he loved glory but a little, and if he had had the entiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is seful.

He had no heart. He went out with his umbrella nder his arm, and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole. He was a bit f a mason, a bit of a gardener, something of a doctor; he bled a postilion who ad tumbled from his horse; Louis Philippe no more went about without his ancet, than did Henri IV. without his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this idiculous king, the first who had ever shed blood with the object of ealing.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.11#We will state it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.12#Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation of family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does ot like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity, which is displeasing to the eople, who have the 14th of July in their civil and Austerlitz in their ilitary tradition.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.13#Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled irst of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his family was eserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of admiration. Virtues here dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis Philippe’s daughters, Marie ’Orleans, placed the name of her race among artists, as Charles d’Orleans had laced it among poets. She made of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne ’Arc. Two of Louis Philippe’s daughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium: They are young people such as are rarely seen, and princes such as are never een.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.15#To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of the estoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of the evolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein lay the ortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more complete adaptation of man to an event; the one entered into the other, and the incarnation took lace. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, he had in his favor that great ecommendation to the throne, exile. He had been proscribed, a wanderer, poor. e had lived by his own labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely omains in France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, e gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and ewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie nthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of ont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI., and used by Louis XV. He was the ompanion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged to the acobins’ club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Danton had said to im: “Young man!” At the age of four and twenty, in ’93, being then M. de hartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of Louis XVI., so ell named _that poor tyrant_. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, reaking royalty in the King and the King with royalty, did so almost without oticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the ssembly-Tribunal, the public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to eply, the alarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that ombre breath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, of those who ondemned as well as of the man condemned,—he had looked on those things, he had ontemplated that giddiness; he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of he Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate asser-by who was made responsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy, rise hrough the shadows; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of hese immense justices of the populace, which are almost as impersonal as the ustice of God.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.19#The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has not et sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on his king; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanc has himself ecently softened his first verdict; Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts_ which are called the 221 and 1830, that is to say, by a alf-Parliament, and a half-revolution; and in any case, from the superior point f view where philosophy must place itself, we cannot judge him here, as the eader has seen above, except with certain reservations in the name of the bsolute democratic principle; in the eyes of the absolute, outside these two ights, the right of man in the first place, the right of the people in the econd, all is usurpation; but what we can say, even at the present day, that fter making these reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner e is considered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view f human goodness, will remain, to use the antique language of ancient history, ne of the best princes who ever sat on a throne.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.3.20#What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the king, here remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times even to the oint of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a ay of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent, he returned at night o his apartments, and there, exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, hat did he do? He took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a riminal suit, considering it something to hold his own against Europe, but that t was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He bstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he disputed he ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys, those chatterers of the law_, as he called them. Sometimes the pile of sentences overed his table; he examined them all; it was anguish to him to abandon these iserable, condemned heads. One day, he said to the same witness to whom we have ecently referred: “I won seven last night.” During the early years of his eign, the death penalty was as good as abolished, and the erection of a caffold was a violence committed against the King. The Grève having disappeared ith the elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the ame of the Barrière-Saint-Jacques; “practical men” felt the necessity of a uasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories of Casimir érier, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis hilippe, who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria ith his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: “What a pity that I as not wounded! Then I might have pardoned!” On another occasion, alluding to he resistance offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with a political riminal, who is one of the most generous figures of our day: “His pardon is ranted; it only remains for me to obtain it.” Louis Philippe was as gentle as ouis IX. and as kindly as Henri IV.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.4.1#At the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of enetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the eginning of Louis Philippe’s reign, it was necessary that there should be no quivoque, and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation ith regard to this king.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.4.2#Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without iolence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of a revolutionary hange, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the Revolution, but in hich he, the Duc d’Orléans, exercised no personal initiative. He had been born Prince, and he believed himself to have been elected King. He had not served his mandate on himself; he had not taken it; it had been offered to him, and he ad accepted it; convinced, wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, hat the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in ccordance with duty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say it in ood conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect good faith, and he democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amount of terror discharged y the social conflicts weighs neither on the King nor on the democracy. A clash f principles resembles a clash of elements. The ocean defends the water, the urricane defends the air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends the eople; the relative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, which is the epublic; society bleeds in this conflict, but that which constitutes its uffering to-day will constitute its safety later on; and, in any case, those ho combat are not to be blamed; one of the two parties is evidently mistaken; he right is not, like the Colossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one oot on the republic, and one in Royalty; it is indivisible, and all on one ide; but those who are in error are so sincerely; a blind man is no more a riminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. Let us, then, impute to the fatality of hings alone these formidable collisions. Whatever the nature of these tempests ay be, human irresponsibility is mingled with them.

The exaltation as such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop: “We ave no arms!” One of his comrades replied: “The soldiers have!” thus parodying ithout being aware of the fact, Bonaparte’s proclamation to the army in Italy: When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,” adds one report, “they id not communicate it to each other.” It is not easy to understand what they ould conceal after what they said.

Like those embranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body, the etwork of secret societies began to spread all over the country. From the ssociations of the Friends of the People, which was at the same time public and ecret, sprang the Society of the Rights of Man, which also dated from one of he orders of the day: _Pluviôse, Year 40 of the republican era_, which was estined to survive even the mandate of the Court of Assizes which pronounced ts dissolution, and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections ignificant names like the following:—

Thus, the Gallic Society, and he committee of organization of the Municipalities. Thus the associations for he liberty of the press, for individual liberty, for the instruction of the eople against indirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was ivided into three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers. Then he Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a military footing, our men commanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant, orty by a lieutenant; there were never more than five men who knew each other. reation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped ith the genius of Venice.

All had a revolutionary society which was called he Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.78#In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the aubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than the faubourgs. A afé in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the _Seven Billiards_, Rue es Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallying points for the students. The ociety of the Friends of the A B C affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and o the Cougourde of Aix, met, as we have seen, in the Café Musain. These same oung men assembled also, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop f the Rue Mondétour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. thers were as public as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldness rom these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior rosecutions: “Where was this meeting held?” “In the Rue de la Paix.” “At whose ouse?” “In the street.” “What sections were there?” “Only one.” “Which?” “The anuel section.” “Who was its leader?” “I.” “You are too young to have decided lone upon the bold course of attacking the government.

In Burgundy and in the outhern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, a pole surmounted y a red cap.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.81#The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population, s we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and made it felt. That as the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled like an ant-hill, laborious, ourageous, and angry as a hive of bees, was quivering with expectation and with he desire for a tumult. Everything was in a state of agitation there, without ny interruption, however, of the regular work. It is impossible to convey an dea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant istress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds. It is articularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to ave extremes meet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.82#The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it eceived the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes, slack easons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times of revolution isery is both cause and effect. The blow which it deals rebounds upon it. This opulation full of proud virtue, capable to the highest degree of latent heat, lways ready to fly to arms, prompt to explode, irritated, deep, undermined, eemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on he horizon chased by the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the aubourg Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very ates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.83#The wine-shops of the _Faubourg Antoine_, which have been more than once rawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possess historical otoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words than n wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates here, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. The cabarets of the Faubourg aint-Antoine resemble those taverns of Mont Aventine erected on the cave of the ibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath; taverns where the ables were almost tripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the _sibylline ine_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.84#The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionary gitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popular overeignty. This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like any other; ut, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as of the blind yclops, _Ingens_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.85#In ’93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil, ccording as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there leaped forth rom the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now heroic bands.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.86#Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in the arly days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with uplifted ludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in an uproar, what id they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an end to tyranny, an end to he sword, work for men, instruction for the child, social sweetness for the oman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread for all, the idea for all, the denizing of the world. Progress; and that holy, sweet, and good thing, rogress, they claimed in terrible wise, driven to extremities as they were, alf naked, club in fist, a roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes; but he savages of civilization.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.1.5.87#They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only with fear and rembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemed barbarians, and they ere saviours. They demanded light with the mask of night.

When facts, the remonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the slightest omplication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence arises ruin and new irths. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the uture. Who knows? Perhaps the moment was at hand. The people were again taking ossession of right, and what a fine spectacle! The revolution was again ajestically taking possession of France and saying to the world: “The sequel o-morrow!” Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had at that oment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his wn mind, with Combeferre’s philosophical and penetrating eloquence, Feuilly’s osmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac’s dash, Bahorel’s smile, Jean Prouvaire’s elancholy, Joly’s science, Bossuet’s sarcasms, a sort of electric spark which ook fire nearly everywhere at once.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.1#Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose rack he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building, bearing ff his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than Marius also glided out of the ouse. It was only nine o’clock in the evening. Marius betook himself to ourfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin uarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de la Verrerie “for political reasons”; his quarter was one where, at that epoch, insurrection liked to install itself. arius said to Courfeyrac: “I have come to sleep with you.” Courfeyrac dragged a attress off his bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, nd said: “There.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.2#At seven o’clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the hovel, aid the quarter’s rent which he owed to Ma’am Bougon, had his books, his bed, is table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a hand-cart and went off ithout leaving his address, so that when Javert returned in the course of the orning, for the purpose of questioning Marius as to the events of the preceding vening, he found only Ma’am Bougon, who answered: “Moved away!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.3#Ma’am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice of he robbers who had been seized the night before. “Who would ever have said it?” he exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, “a young man like that, who had he air of a girl!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.4#Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The first was, hat he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, so close at hand, nd in its most repulsive and most ferocious development, a social deformity hich is, perhaps, even more terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor an. The second was, that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would nsue in all probability, and be brought in to testify against Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.5#Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, was afraid, nd had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the time of the ambush; e made some efforts to find him, however, but without success.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.6#A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had earned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the courts, hat Thénardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius had five francs anded in to the clerk’s office of La Force for Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.7#As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from ourfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money. hese periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac who lent and to hénardier who received them. “To whom can they go?” thought Courfeyrac. “Whence an this come to me?” Thénardier asked himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.8#Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a rap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again uried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld very lose at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom he loved, the old man who eemed to be her father, those unknown beings, who were his only interest and is only hope in this world; and, at the very moment when he thought himself on he point of grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark f certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions. o conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he thought he new. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And what was he o think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police? The hite-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the nvalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that that workingman and . Leblanc were one and the same person. So he disguised himself? That man had is heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he led? Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the an whom Thénardier thought that he recognized? Thénardier might have been istaken. These formed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, etracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg. eart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, and night over his yes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could not stir. All had anished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden lluminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also a little, nd casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even heard these mute ounsels of passion. He never said to himself: “What if I were to go to such a lace? What if I were to try such and such a thing?” The girl whom he could no onger call Ursule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what irection he should seek her. His whole life was now summed up in two words; bsolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again; he still spired to this, but he no longer expected it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.9#To crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close to im, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before this, he had iscontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work; it s a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy to get rid of, and difficult to ake up again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.10#A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses. t lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimes severe, nd produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over-harsh ontours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there, binds together and ounds off the angles of the ideas. But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe o the brain-worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into everie! He thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells himself hat, after all, it is the same thing. Error!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.11#Thought is the toil of the intelligence, reverie its voluptuousness. To eplace thought with reverie is to confound a poison with a food.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.12#Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had upervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimæras without bject or bottom. One no longer emerges from one’s self except for the purpose f going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and stagnant gulf. And, in roportion as labor diminishes, needs increase. This is a law.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.17#Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes fixed n the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seems strange, and et it is true. The memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the eart; the more it has disappeared, the more it beams; the gloomy and despairing oul sees this light on its horizon; the star of the inner night. She—that was arius’ whole thought. He meditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious hat his old coat was becoming an impossible coat, and that his new coat was rowing old, that his shirts were wearing out, that his hat was wearing out, hat his boots were giving out, and he said to himself: “If I could but see her nce again before I die!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.18#One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that her lance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she did know is soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place, she still oved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was hinking of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced y every heart that loves, though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and et felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said to himself: “It is her thoughts that re coming to me!” Then he added: “Perhaps my thoughts reach her also.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.1.19#This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, was sufficient, evertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope, into his soul. From ime to time, especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to ven the dreamy, he allowed the purest, the most impersonal, the most ideal of he reveries which filled his brain, to fall upon a notebook which contained othing else. He called this “writing to her.”

Marius urveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, what passed before his yes, even the most indifferent deeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on verything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness. His udgment, which was almost wholly disassociated from hope, held itself aloof and oared on high.

It was ell that he did so. He was free. As for Éponine, Javert had caused her to be eized; a mediocre consolation. Éponine had joined Azelma at Les adelonettes.

It was not known how this had een effected, the police agents and the sergeants “could not understand it at ll.” He had converted himself into vapor, he had slipped through the handcuffs, e had trickled through the crevices of the carriage, the fiacre was cracked, nd he had fled; all that they were able to say was, that on arriving at the rison, there was no Claquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand n it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had here been unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belong to the ouble enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with infraction and epression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in uthority? Javert did not accept such comminations, and would have bristled up gainst such compromises; but his squad included other inspectors besides imself, who were more initiated than he, perhaps, although they were his ubordinates in the secrets of the Prefecture, and Claquesous had been such a illain that he might make a very good agent. It is an excellent thing for uffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling erms with the night. These double-edged rascals do exist.

He had een let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, and the eyes of the watchers were ixed on him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.9#This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that hideous ourtyard, called the court of the Bâtiment-Neuf (New Building), which the dministration called the court Saint-Bernard, and which the robbers called the osse-aux-Lions (The Lion’s Ditch), on that wall covered with scales and eprosy, which rose on the left to a level with the roofs, near an old door of usty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of La Force, hen turned in a dormitory for ruffians, there could still be seen, twelve years go, a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail, and beneath it his signature:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.11#The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.12#The latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau house, as a very cunning and very adroit young spark, with a bewildered and plaintive ir. It was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had eleased him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagne yard than in close onfinement.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.13#Robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of ustice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that. To be n prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime. They re artists, who have one picture in the salon, and who toil, nonetheless, on a ew work in their studios.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.14#Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seen tanding by the hour together in front of the sutler’s window in the Charlemagne ard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with: garlic_, 62 _centimes_, and ended with: _cigar_, 5 _centimes_. Or he passed his ime in trembling, chattering his teeth, saying that he had a fever, and nquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was acant.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.15#All at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered that rujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different commissions executed by he errand-men of the establishment, not under his own name, but in the name of hree of his comrades; and they had cost him in all fifty sous, an exorbitant utlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.16#Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissions osted in the convict’s parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous could be nalyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Panthéon, ten sous; one to al-de-Grâce, fifteen sous; and one to the Barrière de Grenelle, twenty-five ous. This last was the dearest of the whole tariff. Now, at the Panthéon, at he Val-de-Grâce, and at the Barrière de Grenelle were situated the domiciles of he three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarro, lorieux, an ex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the olice was directed by this incident. It was thought that these men were members f Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer, had been captured. t was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed, not to houses, but o people who were waiting for them in the street, must have contained nformation with regard to some crime that had been plotted. They were in ossession of other indications; they laid hand on the three prowlers, and upposed that they had circumvented some one or other of Brujon’s achinations.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.17#About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as the uperintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the âtiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the box—this was the means dopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually; every our a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the ormitories—a watchman looked through the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld rujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the hall-lamp. he guardian entered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they ere not able to seize what he had written. The police learned nothing further bout it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.18#What is certain is, that on the following morning, a “postilion” was flung rom the Charlemagne yard into the Lions’ Ditch, over the five-story building hich separated the two court-yards.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.19#What prisoners call a “postilion” is a pallet of bread artistically oulded, which is sent _into Ireland_, that is to say, over the roofs of a rison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England; from one land to nother; _into Ireland_. This little pellet falls in the yard. The man who picks t up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard. f it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, he forwards the note to its estination; if it is a keeper, or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are alled _sheep_ in prisons and _foxes_ in the galleys, the note is taken to the ffice and handed over to the police.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.20#On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the person o whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary confinement. This erson was no other than Babet, one of the four heads of Patron Minette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.21#The postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines were ritten:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.22#“Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.23#This is what Brujon had written the night before.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.24#In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note on rom La Force to the Salpêtrière, to a “good friend” whom he had and who was hut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her cquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspected by the police, though ot yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name the reader has already seen, had elations with the Thénardier, which will be described in detail later on, and he could, by going to see Éponine, serve as a bridge between the Salpêtrière nd Les Madelonettes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.25#It happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting in the nvestigation directed against Thénardier in the matter of his daughters, ponine and Azelma were released. When Éponine came out, Magnon, who was atching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her Brujon’s note to Babet, harging her to look into the matter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.26#Éponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden, bserved the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to Magnon, who elivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon transmitted to Babet’s istress in the Salpêtrière. A biscuit, in the shady symbolism of prisons, ignifies: Nothing to be done.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.27#So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in the ircle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the other on his way rom it:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.28#“Well?” asked Brujon, “the Rue P.?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.29#“Biscuit,” replied Babet. Thus did the fœtus of crime engendered by Brujon n La Force miscarry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.2.30#This miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectly istinct from Brujon’s programme. The reader will see what they were.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.1#Marius no longer went to see any one, but he sometimes encountered Father abeuf by chance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.2#While Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be alled the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, where the appy can be heard walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on his side.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.3#The _Flora of Cauteretz_ no longer sold at all. The experiments on indigo ad not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which had a bad xposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and ampness. Nevertheless, he did not become discouraged. He had obtained a corner n the Jardin des Plantes, with a good exposure, to make his trials with indigo at his own expense.” For this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the Flora_. He had reduced his breakfast to two eggs, and he left one of these for is old servant, to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And ften his breakfast was his only meal. He no longer smiled with his infantile mile, he had grown morose and no longer received visitors. Marius did well not o dream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when M. Mabeuf was on his way o the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man passed each other on he Boulevard de l’Hôpital. They did not speak, and only exchanged a melancholy ign of the head. A heart-breaking thing it is that there comes a moment when isery looses bonds! Two men who have been friends become two chance assers-by.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.4#Royol the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books, his arden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness, pleasure, and ope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for his living. He said to himself: When I shall have made my balls of blueing, I shall be rich, I will withdraw my opperplates from the pawn-shop, I will put my _Flora_ in vogue again with rickery, plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and I will buy, I now well where, a copy of Pierre de Médine’s _Art de Naviguer_, with wood-cuts, dition of 1655.” In the meantime, he toiled all day over his plot of indigo, nd at night he returned home to water his garden, and to read his books. At hat epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.5#One evening he had a singular apparition.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.6#He had returned home while it was still broad daylight. Mother Plutarque, hose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dined on a bone, on which little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen able, and had seated himself on an overturned stone post, which took the place f a bench in his garden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.7#Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a sort of arge chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a rabbit-hutch on the ground loor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in the hutch, but there ere a few apples in the fruit-closet,—the remains of the winter’s rovision.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.8#M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of his lasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, a serious hing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity rendered him ccessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree. The first of hese books was the famous treatise of President Delancre, _De l’Inconstance des émons_; the other was a quarto by Mutor de la Rubaudière, _Sur les Diables de auvert et les Gobelins de la Bièvre_. This last-mentioned old volume interested im all the more, because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by oblins in former times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and o blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held in his and, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a magnificent hododendron which was one of his consolations; four days of heat, wind, and sun ithout a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks were bending, the buds drooping, he leaves falling; all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularly ad. Father Mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls. The old an had toiled all day over his indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but e rose, laid his books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with ottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could ot even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round and cast a lance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.9#The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath n indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised to be as arid as he day had been.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.11#And his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon his reast.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.12#He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.13#“A tear of dew! A little pity!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.14#He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.15#At that moment, he heard a voice saying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.16#“Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.17#At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in he hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall, slender irl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him. She had less he air of a human being than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the wilight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.18#Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have aid, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, this being, hose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, had unhooked the hain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled the watering-pot, and the oodman beheld this apparition, which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat, unning about among the flower-beds distributing life around her. The sound of he watering-pot on the leaves filled Father Mabeuf’s soul with ecstasy. It eemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.3.19#The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She atered the whole garden.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.4.1#Some days after this visit of a “spirit” to Farmer Mabeuf, one morning,—it as on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from ourfeyrac for Thénardier—Marius had put this coin in his pocket, and before arrying it to the clerk’s office, he had gone “to take a little stroll,” in the ope that this would make him work on his return. It was always thus, however. s soon as he rose, he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in rder to scribble some translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning nto French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny ontroversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to write one, ould not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose from his chair, aying: “I shall go out.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.4.5#He lived in the Lark’s meadow more than in Courfeyrac’s lodgings. That was is real address: Boulevard de la Santé, at the seventh tree from the Rue roulebarbe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.4.6#That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the arapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated the freshly nfolded and luminous leaves.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.4.7#He was dreaming of “Her.” And his meditation turning to a reproach, fell ack upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his paralysis of oul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which was growing more dense very moment before him, to such a point that he no longer even saw the sun.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.2.4.8#Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which as not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and he had no onger the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholy absorption, ensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him, beneath him, on both anks of the river, the laundresses of the Gobelins beating their linen, and bove his head, the birds chattering and singing in the elm-trees. On the one and, the sound of liberty, the careless happiness of the leisure which has ings; on the other, the sound of toil. What caused him to meditate deeply, and lmost reflect, were two cheerful sounds.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.head#CHAPTER I—THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.1#About the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament of aris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period the grand eignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois concealed them, had “a ittle house” built in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, hich is now called Rue Plumet, not far from the spot which was then designated s _Combat des Animaux_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.2#This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on the round floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen downstairs, a boudoir pstairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a garden with a large ate opening on the street. This garden was about an acre and a half in extent. his was all that could be seen by passers-by; but behind the pavilion there was narrow courtyard, and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of wo rooms and a cellar, a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and urse in case of need. This building communicated in the rear by a masked door hich opened by a secret spring, with a long, narrow, paved winding corridor, pen to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden with wonderful rt, and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land, all of hose angles and detours it followed, ended in another door, also with a secret ock which opened a quarter of a league away, almost in another quarter, at the olitary extremity of the Rue du Babylone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.3#Through this the chief justice entered, so that even those who were spying n him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook imself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, and would never have suspected hat to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go to the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever urchasers of land, the magistrate had been able to make a secret, sewer-like assage on his own property, and consequently, without interference. Later on, e had sold in little parcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of round adjoining the corridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides hought they had a party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect the ong, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and their rchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable that the linnets nd tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief ustice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.4#The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted and urnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashioned on the utside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had something discreet, oquettish, and solemn about it, as befits a caprice of love and magistracy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.5#This house and corridor, which have now disappeared, were in existence ifteen years ago. In ’93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of emolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; the nation made him ankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith. After that, he house remained uninhabited, and fell slowly to ruin, as does every dwelling o which the presence of man does not communicate life. It had remained fitted ith its old furniture, was always for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen eople who passed through the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and llegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.6#Towards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might have oticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on the first loor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. The windows had short urtains, a sign that there was a woman about.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.7#In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presented himself nd had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course, the back uilding and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He had had the secret penings of the two doors to this passage repaired. The house, as we have just entioned, was still very nearly furnished with the justice’s old fitting; the ew tenant had ordered some repairs, had added what was lacking here and there, ad replaced the paving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, steps in the tairs, missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows, nd had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly aid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is slipping in than ike a man who is entering his own house. The neighbors did not gossip about im, for the reason that there were no neighbors.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.8#This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette. The ervant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had saved from the ospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, a stammerer, and from the rovinces, three qualities which had decided Jean Valjean to take her with him. e had hired the house under the name of M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. n all that has been related heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, been no less rompt than Thénardier to recognize Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.9#Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What had appened?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.10#Nothing had happened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.11#It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy hat his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every day, he felt aternity spring up and develop within him more and more, he brooded over the oul of that child, he said to himself that she was his, that nothing could take er from him, that this would last indefinitely, that she would certainly become nun, being thereto gently incited every day, that thus the convent was enceforth the universe for her as it was for him, that he should grow old here, and that she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that e should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation was ossible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He interrogated imself. He asked himself if all that happiness were really his, if it were not omposed of the happiness of another, of the happiness of that child which he, n old man, was confiscating and stealing; if that were not theft? He said to imself, that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it, that to eprive her in advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, nder the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her gnorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in er, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to God. And who knows f, when she came to be aware of all this some day, and found herself a nun to er sorrow, Cosette would not come to hate him? A last, almost selfish thought, nd less heroic than the rest, but which was intolerable to him. He resolved to uit the convent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.12#He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was ecessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years’ sojourn between these our walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the lements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men. He had grown old, and ll had undergone a change. Who would recognize him now? And then, to face the orst, there was danger only for himself, and he had no right to condemn Cosette o the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys. esides, what is danger in comparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented is being prudent and taking his precautions.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.13#As for Cosette’s education, it was almost finished and complete.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.14#His determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not long n presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.15#Jean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her hat, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother, which ermitted him henceforth to live without working, he should leave the service of he convent and take his daughter with him; but that, as it was not just that osette, since she had not taken the vows, should have received her education ratuitously, he humbly begged the Reverend Prioress to see fit that he should ffer to the community, as indemnity, for the five years which Cosette had spent here, the sum of five thousand francs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.16#It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Perpetual doration.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.17#On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the key o which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter to touch it. his puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which proceeded from t.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.18#Let us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. He always ad it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, that he arried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at it, and called his valise his _inseparable_, saying: “I am jealous of it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.19#Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air without rofound anxiety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.20#He discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself from sight here. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:—Ultime Fauchelevent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.21#At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that he ight attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same uarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the slightest isquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that he might not again be aught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from avert. These two apartments were very pitiable, poor in appearance, and in two uarters which were far remote from each other, the one in the Rue de l’Ouest, he other in the Rue de l’Homme Armé.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.1.22#He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l’Homme Armé, now to the Rue e l’Ouest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint. He had imself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a gentleman from the uburbs, living on his funds, and having a little temporary resting-place in own. This lofty virtue had three domiciles in Paris for the sake of escaping rom the police.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.head#CHAPTER II—JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.1#However, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had arranged is existence there in the following fashion:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.2#Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big leeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the gilded illets, the justice’s drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vast rmchairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask n three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in the Rue du iguier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher’s, put into Cosette’s chamber, and, in rder to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things, he had amalgamated ith this bric-à-brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture uitable to young girls, an étagère, a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an nkstand, a blotting-book, paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a ilver-gilt dressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. Long damask urtains with a red foundation and three colors, like those on the bed, hung at he windows of the first floor. On the ground floor, the curtains were of apestry. All winter long, Cosette’s little house was heated from top to bottom. ean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter’s lodge which was situated at the end f the back courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two traw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his eloved valise in one corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette, and he ad a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.3#When Toussaint came, he had said to her: “It is the young lady who is the istress of this house.”—“And you, monsieur?” Toussaint replied in amazement.—“I m a much better thing than the master, I am the father.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.4#Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulated heir expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put his arm hrough Cosette’s and took her for a walk. He led her to the Luxembourg, to the east frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her to mass at aint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off. As it was a very oor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the poor people surrounded him n church, which had drawn down upon him Thénardier’s epistle: “To the enevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.” He was fond of aking Cosette to visit the poor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the ouse in the Rue Plumet. Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean ent himself for water to a fountain nearby on the boulevard. Their wood and ine were put into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay ear the Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice as a rotto; for at the epoch of follies and “Little Houses” no love was without a rotto.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.5#In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined for he reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants of the avilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, the entire sefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love affair, and the onfidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to the tax-collector’s notices, nd the summons of the guard. For M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman, elonged to the national guard; he had not been able to escape through the fine eshes of the census of 1831. The municipal information collected at that time ad even reached the convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable and oly cloud, whence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, and, onsequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town-hall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.6#Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mounted uard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise which mixed him ith every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean had just attained his ixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he did not appear to be over ifty; moreover, he had no desire to escape his sergeant-major nor to quibble ith Comte de Lobau; he possessed no civil status, he was concealing his name, e was concealing his identity, so he concealed his age, he concealed verything; and, as we have just said, he willingly did his duty as a national uard; the sum of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his axes. This man had for his ideal, within, the angel, without, the ourgeois.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.7#Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with Cosette, e dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air of a retired officer. hen he went out alone, which was generally at night, he was always dressed in a orkingman’s trousers and blouse, and wore a cap which concealed his face. Was his precaution or humility? Both. Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical ide of her destiny, and hardly noticed her father’s peculiarities. As for oussaint, she venerated Jean Valjean, and thought everything he did right.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.8#One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, said to er: “That’s a queer fish.” She replied: “He’s a saint.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.9#Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged xcept by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the garden gate t would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet. That ate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated, in order ot to attract attention.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.2.10#In this, possibly, he made a mistake.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.head#CHAPTER III—FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.1#The garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become xtraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at t, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant epths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his yes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient, padlocked gate, wisted, tottering, fastened to two green and moss-covered pillars, and oddly rowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.2#There was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues, several attices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on the wall, and here were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grass everywhere. Gardening ad taken its departure, and nature had returned. Weeds abounded, which was a reat piece of luck for a poor corner of land. The festival of gilliflowers was omething splendid. Nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of hings towards life; venerable growth reigned there among them. The trees had ent over towards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the branch had nclined, that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which xpands in the air, that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that hich trails in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres, clusters, tendrils, hoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed, married, confounded themselves in ach other; vegetation in a deep and close embrace, had celebrated and ccomplished there, under the well-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure hree hundred feet square, the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human raternity. This garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, that s to say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled as a city, uivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant like a bouquet, olitary as a tomb, living as a throng.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.3#In Floréal34 this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its our walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in the rising un, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love, and which eels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins, and shakes to the wind ts enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced tatues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the eserted street, flowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, oy, perfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and it as a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in lakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure, a throng of nnocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the twittering forgot to say he humming completed. In the evening, a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden nd enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness covered it; the ntoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every art of it, like an exquisite and subtle poison; the last appeals of the oodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches; one elt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice he leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.4#In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, and llowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches and dew in he flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold, hick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion, under any aspect, at all easons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this tiny enclosure breathed forth elancholy, contemplation, solitude, liberty, the absence of man, the presence f God; and the rusty old gate had the air of saying: “This garden belongs to e.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.5#It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side, he classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces away, he dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputies not far off; he carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled uxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain did the yellow, brown, white, and ed omnibuses cross each other’s course at the neighboring crossroads; the Rue lumet was the desert; and the death of the former proprietors, the revolution hich had passed over it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, orgetfulness, forty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore o this privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great rimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy nd rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to eappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur; nd for nature, which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man, and which sheds erself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all, in the ant as well s in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with as much ude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.3.6#Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound and enetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolute satisfaction is iven to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect, he contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these ecompositions of force terminating in unity. Everything toils at verything.

Who, then, can calculate the course of a olecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the all of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely reat and the infinitely little, the reverberations of causes in the precipices f being, and the avalanches of creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the reat is little, the little is great; everything is balanced in necessity; larming vision for the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and hings; in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despises he other; all have need of each other. The light does not bear away terrestrial erfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it is doing; the night istributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers. All birds that fly have ound their leg the thread of the infinite. Germination is complicated with the ursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and t places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. here the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two possesses the arger field of vision? Choose. A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula s an ant-hill of stars. The same promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, xists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance. lements and principles mingle, combine, wed, multiply with each other, to such point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same learness. The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself. In the vast osmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities, olling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia, employing everything, not osing a single dream, not a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, rumbling to bits a planet there, oscillating and winding, making of light a orce and of thought an element, disseminated and invisible, dissolving all, xcept that geometrical point, the _I_; bringing everything back to the oul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, from summit to ase, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the flight of an insect o the movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows? Were it only by the dentity of the law, the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling f the infusoria in the drop of water. A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, he prime motor of which is the gnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.1#It seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal wanton ysteries, had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries. here were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, or tunnels, or grottos; here was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all. aphos had been made over into Eden. It is impossible to say what element of epentance had rendered this retreat wholesome. This flower-girl now offered her lossom to the soul. This coquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had eturned to virginity and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a goodman ho thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman who hought that he was a continuation of Lenôtre, had turned it about, cut, uffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; nature had taken possession of it once ore, had filled it with shade, and had arranged it for love.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.2#There was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Love had nly to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure, grass, moss, the ight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and a soul made of sweetness, f faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration, and of illusion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.3#Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was a ittle more than fourteen, and she was at the “ungrateful age”; we have already aid, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely rather than pretty; he had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward, thin, timid and bold at nce, a grown-up little girl, in short.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.4#Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught religion, nd even and above all, devotion; then “history,” that is to say the thing that ears that name in convents, geography, grammar, the participles, the kings of rance, a little music, a little drawing, etc.; but in all other respects she as utterly ignorant, which is a great charm and a great peril. The soul of a oung girl should not be left in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt nd too lively are formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently and iscreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than with their arsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere half-light which issipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There is nothing but the maternal nstinct, that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and he experience of the woman, which knows how this half-light is to be created nd of what it should consist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.5#Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world are ot worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl’s soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.6#Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the lural.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.7#As for Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude; but he as only an old man and he knew nothing at all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.8#Now, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing a woman or life, what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called nnocence!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.9#Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The convent urns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart, thus thrown back pon itself, works downward within itself, since it cannot overflow, and grows eep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions, suppositions, conjectures, outlines f romances, a desire for adventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built holly in the inner obscurity of the mind, sombre and secret abodes where the assions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to nter. The convent is a compression which, in order to triumph over the human eart, should last during the whole life.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.10#On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and ore dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuation of olitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that was closed, but a nature hat was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant; the same dreams as in the onvent, but with glimpses of young men; a grating, but one that opened on the treet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.11#Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean aljean gave this neglected garden over to her. “Do what you like with it,” he aid to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the clumps and all the tones, she hunted for “beasts”; she played in it, while awaiting the time when he would dream in it; she loved this garden for the insects that she found eneath her feet amid the grass, while awaiting the day when she would love it or the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.12#And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with all her oul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and harming companion to her. It will be remembered that M. Madeleine had been in he habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean had continued this practice; he ad come to converse well; he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a rue and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself. He retained just nough sharpness to season his kindness; his mind was rough and his heart was oft. During their conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of verything, drawing on what he had read, and also on what he had suffered. As he listened to him, Cosette’s eyes wandered vaguely about.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.13#This simple man sufficed for Cosette’s thought, the same as the wild arden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after the utterflies, she came panting up to him and said: “Ah! How I have run!” He issed her brow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.14#Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where Jean aljean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor he garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard, than in the nclosure filled with flowers, and in his little lodge furnished with traw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry, against hich stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjean sometimes said to her, smiling at is happiness in being importuned: “Do go to your own quarters! Leave me alone a ittle!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.15#She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful hen they come from a daughter to her father.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.16#“Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don’t you have a carpet here nd a stove?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.17#“Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who have ot even a roof over their heads.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.18#“Then why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.19#“Because you are a woman and a child.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.20#“Bah! must men be cold and feel uncomfortable?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.21#“Certain men.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.22#“That is good, I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have fire.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.23#And again she said to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.24#“Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.25#“Because, my daughter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.26#“Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.27#Then, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean ate hite bread.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.28#Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayed orning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The Thénardiers had emained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. She remembered that she had one “one day, at night,” to fetch water in a forest. She thought that it had een very far from Paris. It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an byss, and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it. Her childhood roduced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her ut millepeds, spiders, and serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before alling asleep, as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean’s aughter, and that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother ad passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.29#When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and ropped a silent tear, saying to herself: “Perhaps this man is my mother.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.30#Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profound gnorance of a girl brought up in a convent,—maternity being also absolutely nintelligible to virginity,—had ended by fancying that she had had as little other as possible. She did not even know her mother’s name. Whenever she asked ean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained silent. If she repeated her question, he esponded with a smile. Once she insisted; the smile ended in a tear.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.31#This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with arkness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.32#Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliver this ame to the hazards of another memory than his own?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.33#So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talk o her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossible for him to o so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared. Was it because of Cosette? Was t because of Fantine? He felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow nter Cosette’s thought; and of placing a third in their destiny. The more acred this shade was to him, the more did it seem that it was to be feared. He hought of Fantine, and felt himself overwhelmed with silence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.34#Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared to ave its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been in Fantine, and hich had violently quitted her during her lifetime, returned to rest upon her fter her death, to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman, and n its shyness, to keep her in her grave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously ubmitting to the pressure? We who believe in death, are not among the number ho will reject this mysterious explanation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.35#Hence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name of antine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.36#One day Cosette said to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.37#“Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings. My other must have been almost a saint during her life.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.38#“Through martyrdom,” replied Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.39#However, Jean Valjean was happy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.4.40#When Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud and happy, in he plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within him with elight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, so wholly satisfied ith himself alone. The poor man trembled, inundated with angelic joy; he eclared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives; he told imself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a liss, and he thanked God, in the depths of his soul, for having permitted him o be loved thus, he, a wretch, by that innocent being.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.1#One day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she said to erself: “Really!” It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This threw her n a singularly troubled state of mind. Up to that moment she had never thought f her face. She saw herself in her mirror, but she did not look at herself. And hen, she had so often been told that she was homely; Jean Valjean alone said ently: “No indeed! no indeed!” At all events, Cosette had always thought erself homely, and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of hildhood. And here, all at once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean ad said: “No indeed!” That night, she did not sleep. “What if I were pretty!” he thought. “How odd it would be if I were pretty!” And she recalled those of er companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent, and she aid to herself: “What! Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.2#The next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident this time, nd she was assailed with doubts: “Where did I get such an idea?” said she; “no, am ugly.” She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes were sunken and she as pale. She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief hat she was beautiful, but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it ny longer. She did not look at herself again, and for more than a fortnight she ried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.3#In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or did some onvent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean read beside her. Once he raised her eyes from her work, and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner n which her father was gazing at her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.4#On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemed to her hat some one behind her, whom she did not see, said: “A pretty woman! but badly ressed.” “Bah!” she thought, “he does not mean me. I am well dressed and ugly.” he was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.5#At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old Toussaint aying: “Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?” Cosette did not hear er father’s reply, but Toussaint’s words caused a sort of commotion within her. he fled from the garden, ran up to her room, flew to the looking-glass,—it was hree months since she had looked at herself,—and gave vent to a cry. She had ust dazzled herself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.6#She was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing with Toussaint nd her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, her hair was ustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes. The onsciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant, like the sudden advent f daylight; other people noticed it also, Toussaint had said so, it was vidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken, there could no longer be any oubt of that; she descended to the garden again, thinking herself a queen, magining that she heard the birds singing, though it was winter, seeing the sky ilded, the sun among the trees, flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in nexpressible delight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.7#Jean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at eart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.8#In fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with terror that eauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette’s sweet face. The awn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.9#Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became ware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected light which as rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl’s person, wounded ean Valjean’s sombre eye. He felt that it was a change in a happy life, a life o happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something. This an, who had passed through all manner of distresses, who was still all bleeding rom the bruises of fate, who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a aint, who, after having dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the nvisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not eleased from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back rom the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium, his man accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, and merely asked of rovidence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature, of the world, one thing, hat Cosette might love him!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.11#Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface, made im shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never known very istinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he understood nstinctively, that it was something terrible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.12#He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever more riumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocent and ormidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, of his old ge, of his misery, of his reprobation.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.16#On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself: “Decidedly am beautiful!” Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet. She recalled the emark of that passer-by: “Pretty, but badly dressed,” the breath of an oracle hich had passed beside her and had vanished, after depositing in her heart one f the two germs which are destined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, oquetry. Love is the other.

Her father had ever refused her anything. She at once acquired the whole science of the onnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the stuff which is in fashion, he color which is becoming, that science which makes of the Parisian woman omething so charming, so deep, and so dangerous.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.20#Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt that he could ever do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings sprouting on osette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.21#Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette’s toilet, a woman would have ecognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little proprieties, certain pecial conventionalities, were not observed by Cosette. A mother, for instance, ould have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask.

He kept to his back yard, like a dog.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.5.29#Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the grace f ignoring it.

But what she had lost in ingenuous grace, she gained in pensive and serious harm. Her whole person, permeated with the joy of youth, of innocence, and of eauty, breathed forth a splendid melancholy.

The next morning, on waking, she thought of that strange young man, so ong indifferent and icy, who now seemed to pay attention to her, and it did not ppear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her. he was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful ndividual.

And then, strange to say, the first symptom of true love n a young man is timidity; in a young girl it is boldness. This is surprising, nd yet nothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach each ther and assuming, each the other’s qualities.

She no onger recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young girls, which is composed of oldness and gayety, resembles snow. It melts in love, which is its sun.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.6.12#Cosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word uttered n its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which entered the onvent, _amour_ (love) was replaced by _tambour_ (drum) or _pandour_. This reated enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the _big girls_, such as: Ah, how delightful is the drum! _ or, _Pity is not a pandour_. But Cosette had eft the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the “drum.” herefore, she did not know what name to give to what she now felt. Is any one he less ill because one does not know the name of one’s malady?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.6.13#She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She did ot know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or dangerous, ternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved. She would have been reatly astonished, had any one said to her: “You do not sleep? But that is orbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very bad! You have oppressions and alpitations of the heart? That must not be! You blush and turn pale, when a ertain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk? But that s abominable!” She would not have understood, and she would have replied: “What ault is there of mine in a matter in which I have no power and of which I know othing?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.6.14#It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to he state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mute ontemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition of youth to outh, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream, the onged-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, but having as yet, neither ame, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor defect; in a word, the distant over who lingered in the ideal, a chimæra with a form. Any nearer and more alpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette at this first stage, when she was till half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the ears of children and all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, ith which she had been permeated for the space of five years, was still in the rocess of slow evaporation from her person, and made everything tremble around er. In this situation he was not a lover, he was not even an admirer, he was a ision. She set herself to adoring Marius as something charming, luminous, and mpossible.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.6.18#Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.6.19#It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed, beautiful nd loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and in ignorance of her love. he was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.1#All situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature warned ean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjean shuddered to he very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knew nothing, and yet he canned with obstinate attention, the darkness in which he walked, as though he elt on one side of him something in process of construction, and on the other, omething which was crumbling away. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with he deep law of God, by that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep out of ight of “the father.” Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes spied him. Marius’ manners were no longer in the least natural. He exhibited mbiguous prudence and awkward daring. He no longer came quite close to them as ormerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading; why did e pretend that? Formerly he had come in his old coat, now he wore his new one very day; Jean Valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled, his yes were very queer, he wore gloves; in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested his young man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.2#Cosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was the atter with her she was convinced that there was something in it, and that it ust be concealed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.3#There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently ome to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which as very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might be accidental, no doubt, certainly, ut it was a menacing accident.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.4#He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day, however, e could not refrain from so doing, and, with that vague despair which suddenly asts the lead into the depths of its despair, he said to her: “What a very edantic air that young man has!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.5#Cosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would have eplied: “Why, no, he is charming.” Ten years later, with the love of Marius in er heart, she would have answered: “A pedant, and insufferable to the sight! ou are right!”—At the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained, he contented herself with replying, with supreme calmness: “That young an!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.6#As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.7#“How stupid I am!” thought Jean Valjean. “She had not noticed him. It is I ho have pointed him out to her.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.9#It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of hose vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles, that the oung girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever, and that he young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean had instituted an undeclared ar against Marius, which Marius, with the sublime stupidity of his passion and is age, did not divine. Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him; he hanged his hour, he changed his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came lone to the Luxembourg; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to ll the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he ngenuously answered “yes.” But Cosette remained immured in her apparent nconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjean arrived at he following conclusion: “That ninny is madly in love with Cosette, but Cosette oes not even know that he exists.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.10#Nonetheless did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minute when osette would love might strike at any moment. Does not everything begin with ndifference?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.11#Only once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him. He rose from his seat o depart, after a stay of three hours, and she said: “What, already?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.12#Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he did ot wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things, he feared to rouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers, while osette was sending her smile to the intoxicated Marius, who perceived nothing lse now, and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant ace, Jean Valjean was fixing on Marius flashing and terrible eyes. He, who had inally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling, experienced oments when Marius was present, in which he thought he was becoming savage and erocious once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, which had formerly ontained so much wrath, opening once more and rising up against that young man. t almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.13#What! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came creeping bout, smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying: “Hey!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.14#Jean Valjean added: “Yes, that’s it! What is he in search of? An dventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! And I? What! I have een first, the most wretched of men, and then the most unhappy, and I have raversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have suffered everything that man an suffer, I have grown old without having been young, I have lived without a amily, without relatives, without friends, without life, without children, I ave left my blood on every stone, on every bramble, on every mile-post, along very wall, I have been gentle, though others have been hard to me, and kind, lthough others have been malicious, I have become an honest man once more, in pite of everything, I have repented of the evil that I have done and have orgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the moment when I receive my ecompense, at the moment when it is all over, at the moment when I am just ouching the goal, at the moment when I have what I desire, it is well, it is ood, I have paid, I have earned it, all this is to take flight, all this will anish, and I shall lose Cosette, and I shall lose my life, my joy, my soul, ecause it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.16#It was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemy urveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.17#The reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day he ollowed Cosette to the Rue de l’Ouest. Another day he spoke to the porter. The orter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean: “Monsieur, who is that urious young man who is asking for you?” On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on arius that glance which Marius at last perceived. A week later, Jean Valjean ad taken his departure. He swore to himself that he would never again set foot ither in the Luxembourg or in the Rue de l’Ouest. He returned to the Rue lumet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.18#Cosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, she id not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point where she as afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. Jean Valjean had no xperience of these miseries, the only miseries which are charming and the only nes with which he was not acquainted; the consequence was that he did not nderstand the grave significance of Cosette’s silence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.19#He merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On his side nd on hers, inexperience had joined issue.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.29#Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at this entleness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.30#What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so mpenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place in osette’s soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean remained seated n his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he passed whole nights asking imself: “What has Cosette in her mind?” and in thinking of the things that she ight be thinking about.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.31#Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards that loister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessible glacier of irtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, that convent garden, full f ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where all perfumes and all souls ount straight to heaven! How he adored that Eden forever closed against him, hence he had voluntarily and madly emerged! How he regretted his abnegation and is folly in having brought Cosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, eized and hurled to the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to imself, “What have I done?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.32#However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper, no arshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean’s manners were more ender and more paternal than ever. If anything could have betrayed his lack of oy, it was his increased suavity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.33#On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Marius s she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly being conscious f it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls, a eminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom of her heart, that she must ot seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, and that if this proved to be a atter of indifference to her, her father would take her thither once more. But ays, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette’s tacit onsent. She regretted it. It was too late. So Marius had disappeared; all was ver. The day on which she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer here. What was to be done? Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish t her heart, which nothing relieved, and which augmented every day; she no onger knew whether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining or shining, hether the birds were singing, whether it was the season for dahlias or aisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries, whether he linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough, hether Toussaint had done “her marketing” well or ill; and she remained ejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, her eyes vague and taring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an pparition has vanished.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.34#However, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this, xcept her pallor.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.7.36#This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean. Sometimes e asked her:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.1#Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its sorrows, lways possesses its own peculiar radiance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.2#At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It is he property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He had an nconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. He would have liked o resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and rilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have just said, and at the same ime senile, conveyed to him, by their very childishness, a tolerably just otion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls. He once hanced to see a general on horseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, omte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what appiness it would be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which as an incontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be azzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the uileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice for osette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.3#An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.4#In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell in he Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took a pleasure rip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are ntering life and those who are quitting it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.5#For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a troll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The streets are deserted nd the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird herself, liked to rise early. These atutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening. He proposed, and she greed. It was arranged like a plot, they set out before daybreak, and these rips were so many small delights for Cosette. These innocent eccentricities lease young people.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.6#Jean Valjean’s inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least requented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then existed, in he vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows, which were almost onfounded with the city, where grew in summer sickly grain, and which, in utumn, after the harvest had been gathered, presented the appearance, not of aving been reaped, but peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. osette was not bored there. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, he became a little girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off er hat, laid it on Jean Valjean’s knees, and gathered bunches of flowers. She azed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness and enderness are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within her reast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly. She ove garlands of poppies, which she placed on her head, and which, crossed and enetrated with sunlight, glowing until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a rown of burning embers.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.8#One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of the utumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of day near the arrière du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a delightful and stern oment. A few constellations here and there in the deep, pale azure, the earth ll black, the heavens all white, a quiver amid the blades of grass, everywhere he mysterious chill of twilight. A lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, as carolling at a prodigious height, and one would have declared that that hymn f pettiness calmed immensity. In the East, the Val-de-Grâce projected its dark ass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly rilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its scape from a gloomy edifice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.9#All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few stray aborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to their work long the side-paths.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.10#Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the ate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his back towards he light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising; he had unk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes oncentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which are equivalent to four alls. There are meditations which may be called vertical; when one is at the ottom of them, time is required to return to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged nto one of these reveries. He was thinking of Cosette, of the happiness that as possible if nothing came between him and her, of the light with which she illed his life, a light which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost appy in his reverie. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the louds as they turned rosy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.11#All at once Cosette exclaimed: “Father, I should think some one was coming onder.” Jean Valjean raised his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.12#Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barrière du aine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sèvres, and is cut t right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the causeway and the oulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a noise which it was ifficult to account for at that hour, and a sort of confused pile made its ppearance. Some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning nto the road.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.13#It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it was ristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load could not be istinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips were cracking. By egrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed in shadows. It was a vehicle, n fact, which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway, and which as directing its course towards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a econd, of the same aspect, followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven hariots made their appearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching he rear of the wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes ere visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a lanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as this omething advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turned into a errible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.14#As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the trees ith the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day, which was lowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both epulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned into the faces of orpses, and this is what it proved to be:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.15#Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six were ingularly constructed. They resembled coopers’ drays; they consisted of long adders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities. Each ray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached to four horses harnessed andem. On these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn. In the faint ight, these men were to be divined rather than seen. Twenty-four on each ehicle, twelve on a side, back to back, facing the passers-by, their legs angling in the air,—this was the manner in which these men were travelling, and ehind their backs they had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and n their necks something which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each man had is collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four and twenty men had ccasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with a sort of nexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a ackbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds. In the back and front of each ehicle, two men armed with muskets stood erect, each holding one end of the hain under his foot. The iron necklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge ack-sided baggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and arried a sonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and chains, mong which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full ength, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all lattice-work, was garnished ith dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments. hese vehicles kept to the middle of the road. On each side marched a double edge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing three-cornered hats, like the oldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered with spots and holes, muffled in niforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers’ men, half gray, half blue, hich were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, hort sabres, muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards. hese myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the uthority of the executioner. The one who appeared to be their chief held a ostilion’s whip in his hand. All these details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, ecame more and more clearly outlined as the light increased. At the head and in he rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes, serious and with sword in ist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.16#This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the arrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng, sprung, it s impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as is frequently the ase in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on. In the eighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden hoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.17#The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in ilence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen rousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest of their ostume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements were horribly ncongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags. Battered felt ats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, and, side by side with a short louse, a black coat broken at the elbow; many wore women’s headgear, others had askets on their heads; hairy breasts were visible, and through the rent in heir garments tattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, flaming earts, Cupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or hree had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspended nder them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held in his and and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone nd which he seemed to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were o eyes there which were not either dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. he escort troop cursed, the men in chains did not utter a syllable; from time o time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on houlder-blades or skulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags were errible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed ogether, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their fists lenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the rear of the onvoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.

It was vident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain might descend, that t might be followed by another and another, and that their dilapidated garments ould be drenched, that once soaked, these men would not get dry again, that nce chilled, they would not again get warm, that their linen trousers would be lued to their bones by the downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, hat no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from hattering, that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their egs would continue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight f these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn, nd delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies of the air, like rees and stones.

Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins, oaths, and songs xploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts, lluminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity. houghts made their appearance on these faces; it was a terrible moment; visible emons with their masks removed, fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this ild throng remained in gloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills hrough which they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn ccentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there as not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness; nd the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun’s rilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load hich headed the line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top of heir voices with a haggard joviality, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, then famous, alled _The Vestal_; the trees shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, ountenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains roned by spectres.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.21#All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to be ound the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, bald heads, ray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savage grins, senseless ttitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those of young girls with orkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages, and by reason of that, orrible thin skeleton faces, to which death alone was lacking. On the first art was a negro, who had been a slave, in all probability, and who could make a omparison of his chains. The frightful leveller from below, shame, had passed ver these brows; at that degree of abasement, the last transformations were uffered by all in their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into ulness, was the equal of intelligence converted into despair. There was no hoice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the ud. It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean rocession had not classified them. These beings had been fettered and coupled ell-mell, in alphabetical disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those arts. Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving a esult; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, each chain exhaled a ommon soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By the side of the one here they were singing, there was one where they were howling; a third where hey were begging; one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth; nother load menaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as ilent as the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of ell on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures, performed in inister wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, but, hat was more mournful than that, on the gibbet cart.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.23#As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be the aptain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful dull and lind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon the seven ray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which redoubled the delight of he street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flies on these wounds.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.24#Jean Valjean’s eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were no onger eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in he case of certain wretched men, which seem unconscious of reality, and in hich flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes. He was not looking t a spectacle, he was seeing a vision. He tried to rise, to flee, to make his scape; he could not move his feet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize pon you and hold you fast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, sking himself, athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this sepulchral ersecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing im. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture habitual to those hose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that this was, in fact, the usual tinerary, that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all ossibility of encountering royalty on the road to Fontainebleau, and that, five nd thirty years before, he had himself passed through that barrier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.25#Cosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did not nderstand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; at length she ried:—

But when Cosette was eaving him in the evening, to betake herself to bed, he heard her say in a low oice, and as though talking to herself: “It seems to me, that if I were to find ne of those men in my pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight f him close at hand.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.37#Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day, there as some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,—fêtes in Paris, a review n the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical performances in the hamps-Élysées, fireworks at the Arc de l‘Étoile, illuminations everywhere. Jean aljean did violence to his habits, and took Cosette to see these rejoicings, or the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before, and of ffacing, beneath the smiling tumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which ad passed before her. The review with which the festival was spiced made the resence of uniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a ational guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to helter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object. Cosette, who made it er law to please her father, and to whom, moreover, all spectacles were a ovelty, accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth, nd did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public ête; so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that o trace of that hideous vision remained.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.3.8.38#Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and they ere both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of the rules hich Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and to the custom of emaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, n a wrapper, was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which nvelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud rawn over a star; and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, ubmitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking a daisy o pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, _I love a little, assionately, etc_.—who was there who could have taught her? She was handling he flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy part is to do the same by a heart. If there were a fourth, and smiling Grace alled Melancholy, she would have worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjean was ascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower, and orgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child. A red-breast was arbling in the thicket, on one side. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so ayly, that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette ent on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to be hinking about something; but whatever it was, it must be something charming; ll at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a wan, and said to Jean Valjean: “Father, what are the galleys like?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.1.2#But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to them, hich was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing to those who ere cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits to the poor, n which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse; and ometimes, when the day had been a good one, and they had assisted many in istress, and cheered and warmed many little children, Cosette was rather merry n the evening. It was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette en.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.1.3#On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in the avilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound on his eft arm which was much inflamed, and very angry, which resembled a burn, and hich he explained in some way or other. This wound resulted in his being etained in the house for a month with fever. He would not call in a doctor. hen Cosette urged him, “Call the dog-doctor,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.1.4#Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and uch angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean felt all his ormer joy returning, his fears and anxieties dissipating, and he gazed at osette, saying: “Oh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a good misfortune!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.1.5#Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilion nd again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard. She passed early all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to him the books which he esired. Generally they were books of travel. Jean Valjean was undergoing a new irth; his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the rowling young stranger, Cosette’s coldness,—all these clouds upon his soul were rowing dim. He had reached the point where he said to himself: “I imagined all hat. I am an old fool.”

Then, it as in the month of March, the days were growing longer, the winter was eparting, the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness; then ame April, that daybreak of summer, fresh as dawn always is, gay like every hildhood; a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that it s.

He esolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He strolled out beyond the alpêtrière into deserted regions; that is where windfalls are to be found; here there is no one, one always finds something. He reached a settlement which ppeared to him to be the village of Austerlitz.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.2#In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted y an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable apple-tree. eside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which was not securely astened, and where one might contrive to get an apple. One apple is a supper; ne apple is life. That which was Adam’s ruin might prove Gavroche’s salvation. he garden abutted on a solitary, unpaved lane, bordered with brushwood while waiting the arrival of houses; the garden was separated from it by a hedge.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.3#Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, he ecognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the hedge; a edge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there was not even a cat n the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began the operation of scaling he hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was talking in the garden. Gavroche eeped through one of the breaks in the hedge.

It regulated its pace by that of he first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness and agility ere discernible. This figure had also something fierce and disquieting about t, the whole shape was that of what was then called _an elegant_; the hat was f good shape, the coat black, well cut, probably of fine cloth, and well fitted n at the waist. The head was held erect with a sort of robust grace, and eneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim ight. The profile had a rose in its mouth. This second form was well known to avroche; it was Montparnasse.

A moment later one of these men was underneath the other, roaning, struggling, with a knee of marble upon his breast. Only, it was not ust what Gavroche had expected.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.63#“A thief.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.64#A pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. He stood otionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.65#Every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the witchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried a crook of he knee, twisted his limbs desperately, and made efforts to escape.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.66#The old man did not appear to notice it, and held both his arms with one and, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.67#The old man’s reverie lasted for some time, then, looking steadily at ontparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of the arkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did not lose a ingle syllable:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.68#“My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most aborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare to toil. here is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It is the rolling-mill. ou must be on your guard against it, it is crafty and ferocious; if it catches old of the skirt of your coat, you will be drawn in bodily. That machine is aziness. Stop while there is yet time, and save yourself! Otherwise, it is all ver with you; in a short time you will be among the gearing. Once entangled, ope for nothing more. Toil, lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The ron hand of implacable toil has seized you. You do not wish to earn your iving, to have a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men? ell! You will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will find ennui is torment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be a slave. Toil lets o of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other. You do not desire to e its friend, you shall be its negro slave. Ah! You would have none of the onest weariness of men, you shall have the sweat of the damned. Where others ing, you will rattle in your throat. You will see afar off, from below, other en at work; it will seem to you that they are resting. The laborer, the arvester, the sailor, the blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the lessed spirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds the forge! To guide the lough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in the wind, what elight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll, march! Drag your halter. You re a beast of burden in the team of hell! Ah! To do nothing is your object. ell, not a week, not a day, not an hour shall you have free from oppression. ou will be able to lift nothing without anguish. Every minute that passes will ake your muscles crack. What is a feather to others will be a rock to you. The implest things will become steep acclivities. Life will become monstrous all bout you. To go, to come, to breathe, will be just so many terrible labors. our lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds. Whether ou shall walk here rather than there, will become a problem that must be olved. Any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push, and there he s in the open air. If you wish to go out, you will be obliged to pierce your all. What does every one who wants to step into the street do? He goes ownstairs; you will tear up your sheets, little by little you will make of them rope, then you will climb out of your window, and you will suspend yourself by hat thread over an abyss, and it will be night, amid storm, rain, and the urricane, and if the rope is too short, but one way of descending will remain o you, to fall. To drop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on hat? On what is beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, t the risk of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk of rowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask, of the tones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day, of the laster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A lock presents itself; he bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith. If you wish to pass ut, you will be condemned to execute a terrible work of art; you will take a arge sou, you will cut it in two plates; with what tools? You will have to nvent them. That is your business. Then you will hollow out the interior of hese plates, taking great care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a hread, so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its over. The top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. To he overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will you put n this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you will have cut eeth, and which will form a saw. With this saw, as long as a pin, and concealed n a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock, you will sever bolts, the padlock f your chain, and the bar at your window, and the fetter on your leg. This asterpiece finished, this prodigy accomplished, all these miracles of art, ddress, skill, and patience executed, what will be your recompense if it ecomes known that you are the author? The dungeon. There is your future. What recipices are idleness and pleasure! Do you know that to do nothing is a elancholy resolution? To live in idleness on the property of society! to be seless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the depth of retchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! He will become ermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work? Ah! You have but one thought, to rink well, to eat well, to sleep well. You will drink water, you will eat black read, you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on our flesh all night long, riveted to your limbs. You will break those fetters, ou will flee. That is well. You will crawl on your belly through the brushwood, nd you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest. And you will be ecaptured. And then you will pass years in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, roping for your jug that you may drink, gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness hich dogs would not touch, eating beans that the worms have eaten before you. ou will be a wood-louse in a cellar. Ah! Have pity on yourself, you miserable oung child, who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago, and who have, o doubt, a mother still alive! I conjure you, listen to me, I entreat you. You esire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, to have your hair curled and weet-smelling oils on your locks, to please low women, to be handsome. You will e shaven clean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes. You want rings n your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on your neck. If you glance at a oman, you will receive a blow. And you will enter there at the age of twenty. nd you will come out at fifty! You will enter young, rosy, fresh, with rilliant eyes, and all your white teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair; you ill come out broken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! y poor child, you are on the wrong road; idleness is counselling you badly; the ardest of all work is thieving. Believe me, do not undertake that painful rofession of an idle man. It is not comfortable to become a rascal. It is less isagreeable to be an honest man. Now go, and ponder on what I have said to you. y the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it is.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.69#And the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latter’s and; Montparnasse weighed it for a moment, after which he allowed it to slide ently into the back pocket of his coat, with the same mechanical precaution as hough he had stolen it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.70#All this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back and ranquilly resumed his stroll.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.73#Montparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk. his contemplation was fatal to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.74#While the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.75#Gavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father Mabeuf as still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gamin emerged rom his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the dark, as the atter stood there motionless. In this manner he came up to Montparnasse without eing seen or heard, gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that rock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the purse, withdrew his hand, and having ecourse once more to his crawling, he slipped away like an adder through the hadows. Montparnasse, who had no reason to be on his guard, and who was engaged n thought for the first time in his life, perceived nothing. When Gavroche had nce more attained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the purse over he hedge, and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.4.2.76#The purse fell on Father Mabeuf’s foot. This commotion roused him.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.1#Cosette’s grief, which had been so poignant and lively four or five months reviously, had, without her being conscious of the fact, entered upon its onvalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love for her father, the gayety of the irds and flowers, caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter radually, drop by drop, into that soul, which was so virgin and so young. Was he fire wholly extinct there? Or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed? he truth is, that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.2#One day she suddenly thought of Marius: “Why!” said she, “I no longer think f him.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.3#That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, with a asp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a sword under is arm, waxed moustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing the gate. Moreover, he ad light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round face, was vain, insolent and ood-looking; quite the reverse of Marius. He had a cigar in his mouth. Cosette hought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the ue de Babylone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.4#On the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the our.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.5#From that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.6#The officer’s comrades perceived that there was, in that “badly kept” arden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature, who was lmost always there when the handsome lieutenant,—who is not unknown to the eader, and whose name was Théodule Gillenormand,—passed by.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.7#“See here!” they said to him, “there’s a little creature there who is aking eyes at you, look.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.8#“Have I the time,” replied the lancer, “to look at all the girls who look t me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.9#This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily towards gony, and was saying: “If I could but see her before I die!”—Had his wish been ealized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer, he would ot have been able to utter a word, and he would have expired with grief.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.10#Whose fault was it? No one’s.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.11#Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow nd there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and merge from it again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.12#Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatal hase of feminine reverie abandoned to itself, in which the isolated heart of a oung girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling, as chance directs, to he capital of a marble column or to the post of a wine-shop: A rapid and ecisive moment, critical for every orphan, be she rich or poor, for wealth does ot prevent a bad choice; misalliances are made in very high circles, real isalliance is that of souls; and as many an unknown young man, without name, ithout birth, without fortune, is a marble column which bears up a temple of rand sentiments and grand ideas, so such and such a man of the world satisfied nd opulent, who has polished boots and varnished words, if looked at not utside, but inside, a thing which is reserved for his wife, is nothing more han a block obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous passions; the ost of a drinking-shop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.1.13#What did Cosette’s soul contain? Passion calmed or lulled to sleep; omething limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain depth, and gloomy lower down. he image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.1#During the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. This, as he reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals. He emained absent a day or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? No one knew, ot even Cosette. Once only, on the occasion of one of these departures, she had ccompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner f which she read: _Impasse de la Planchette_. There he alighted, and the coach ook Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone. It was usually when money was lacking n the house that Jean Valjean took these little trips.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.2#So Jean Valjean was absent. He had said: “I shall return in three ays.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.3#That evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get rid of er ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun to sing, accompanying erself the while, the chorus from _Euryanthe_: “Hunters astray in the wood!” hich is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music. When she ad finished, she remained wrapped in thought.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.4#All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the arden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.5#It could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint, she as in bed, and it was ten o’clock at night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.6#She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and laid er ear against it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.7#It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walking ery softly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.8#She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened a small icket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was at the full. verything could be seen as plainly as by day.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.9#There was no one there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.10#She opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that was isible was that the street was deserted as usual.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.11#Cosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she had heard noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent horus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrified depths, which rembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in which one hears the rackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one atches a glimpse through the twilight.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.12#She thought no more about it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.13#Moreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature. There flowed in her veins ome of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot. It will e remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove. There was a foundation of ildness and bravery in her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.14#On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was trolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied er, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the receding evening, as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the usk, and not very far from her; but she told herself that nothing so closely esembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved rom side to side, and she paid no heed to it. Besides, she could see othing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.15#She emerged from “the thicket”; she had still to cross a small lawn to egain the steps.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.16#The moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette’s shadow in front f her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.17#Cosette halted in alarm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.18#Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another hadow, which was particularly startling and terrible, a shadow which had a ound hat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.19#It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border of he clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.20#She stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, or tir, or turn her head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.21#Then she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.22#There was no one there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.23#She glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.24#She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far as he gate, and found nothing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.25#She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this another allucination? What! Two days in succession! One hallucination might pass, but wo hallucinations? The disquieting point about it was, that the shadow had ssuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear round hats.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.26#On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what she hought she had heard and seen. She wanted to be reassured and to see her father hrug his shoulders and say to her: “You are a little goose.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.27#Jean Valjean grew anxious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.28#“It cannot be anything,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.29#He left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she saw him xamining the gate with great attention.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.30#During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she distinctly eard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window. She ran o her little wicket and opened it. In point of fact, there was a man in the arden, with a large club in his hand. Just as she was about to scream, the moon ighted up the man’s profile. It was her father. She returned to her bed, saying o herself: “He is very uneasy!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.31#Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the arden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.32#On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to rise later; t one o’clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst of laughter and er father’s voice calling her:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.33#“Cosette!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.34#She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened her indow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.35#Her father was standing on the grass-plot below.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.36#“I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you,” said he; “look, here is your shadow with the round hat.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.37#And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, and which id indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a ound hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of sheet iron, with a ood, which rose above a neighboring roof.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.38#Cosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions were llayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father, she made erry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney-pots.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.39#Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she did not ay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was really in the irection of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she had seen, and whether he moon had been in the same spot in the sky.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.40#She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot which s afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some one looks at ts shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosette had turned round, nd Cosette had thought herself very sure of this. Cosette’s serenity was fully estored. The proof appeared to her to be complete, and it quite vanished from er mind, whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during he evening or at night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.2.41#A few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.head#CHAPTER III—ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.1#In the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench, creened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms, but which ould, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from the outside, past the rees and the gate.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.2#One evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had gone out; osette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. The breeze was blowing riskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; an objectless sadness was taking ossession of her little by little, that invincible sadness evoked by the vening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows, from the mystery of the tomb hich is ajar at that hour.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.3#Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.4#Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the grass renched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species of melancholy omnambulism in which she was plunged: “Really, one needs wooden shoes for the arden at this hour. One takes cold.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.5#She returned to the bench.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.6#As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot which he had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, evidently, not been there a oment before.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.7#Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once the dea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself, hat some one had placed it there, that an arm had been thrust through the ailing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This time, the fear was genuine; he stone was there. No doubt was possible; she did not touch it, fled without lancing behind her, took refuge in the house, and immediately closed with hutter, bolt, and bar the door-like window opening on the flight of steps. She nquired of Toussaint:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.8#“Has my father returned yet?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.9#“Not yet, Mademoiselle.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.12#“Toussaint,” went on Cosette, “are you careful to thoroughly barricade the hutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, in the evening, and to put he little iron things in the little rings that close them?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.3.13#“Oh! be easy on that score, Miss.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.5.1#As Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment when he raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the handsome officer assed triumphantly in front of the gate,—it was his hour; Cosette thought him ideous.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.5.5.2#She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the most harming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with divers nks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has been added to the nkstand, and consequently on different days. It was, then, a mind which had nfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly, without order, without choice, ithout object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never read anything like it. This anuscript, in which she already perceived more light than obscurity, produced pon her the effect of a half-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines hone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance. The ducation which she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and never f love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame. This anuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love, orrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was as if a hand had pened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light. In these few ines she felt a passionate, ardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an mmense sorrow, and an immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully xpanded. What was this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without ddress, without date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma omposed of truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by virgin, an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of a hantom to a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed eady to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love, his lady, the ecret of fate, the key of life, love. This had been written with one foot in he grave and one finger in heaven. These lines, which had fallen one by one on he paper, were what might be called drops of soul.

It was he! he who had written! he was here! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing! While she was orgetful of him, he had found her again! But had she forgotten him? No, never! he was foolish to have thought so for a single moment. She had always loved im, always adored him. The fire had been smothered, and had smouldered for a ime, but she saw all plainly now; it had but made headway, and now it had burst orth afresh, and had inflamed her whole being. This note-book was like a spark hich had fallen from that other soul into hers. She felt the conflagration tarting up once more.

Cosette was orced to raise her eyes. She thought him insipid, silly, stupid, useless, oppish, displeasing, impertinent, and extremely ugly. The officer thought it is duty to smile at her.

She dared make herself no promises, and she did not wish to refuse erself anything. Flashes of pallor passed over her countenance, and shivers ran hrough her frame. It seemed to her, at intervals, that she was entering the and of chimæras; she said to herself: “Is this reality?” Then she felt of the ear paper within her bosom under her gown, she pressed it to her heart, she elt its angles against her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the oment, he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown oy, which overflowed from beneath her eyelids.—“Oh yes!” she thought, “it is ertainly he!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.head#CHAPTER I—THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.1#Since 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck and as being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss of a bankruptcy, but in the esspool of petty debts, the Thénardier pair had had two other children; both ales. That made five; two girls and three boys.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.2#Madame Thénardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still young nd very small, with remarkable luck.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.3#_Got rid of_ is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in that oman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is more than one example extant. ike the Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thénardier was a mother to her aughters only. There her maternity ended. Her hatred of the human race began ith her own sons. In the direction of her sons her evil disposition was ncompromising, and her heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter. As the eader has seen, she detested the eldest; she cursed the other two. Why? ecause. The most terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of retorts—Because. I have no need of a litter of squalling brats,” said this mother.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.4#Let us explain how the Thénardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their ast two children; and even in drawing profit from the operation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.5#The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the same ne who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two children which he had had. She lived on the Quai des Célestins, at the corner of this ancient treet of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the opportunity of changing her evil epute into good odor. The reader will remember the great epidemic of croup hich ravaged the river districts of the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, nd of which science took advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to he efficacy of inhalations of alum, so beneficially replaced at the present day y the external tincture of iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both er boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the other in the vening of the same day. This was a blow. These children were precious to their other; they represented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were unctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by collector of his rents, M. arge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the ncome was at an end. The Magnon sought an expedient. In that dark free-masonry f evil of which she formed a part, everything is known, all secrets are kept, nd all lend mutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thénardiers had two. he same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good investment or the other. The little Thénardiers became little Magnons. Magnon quitted the uai des Célestins and went to live in the Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the dentity which binds an individual to himself is broken between one street and nother.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.6#The registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, and the ubstitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world. Only, the hénardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs a month, which agnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay. It is unnecessary to add hat M. Gillenormand continued to perform his compact. He came to see the hildren every six months. He did not perceive the change. “Monsieur,” Magnon aid to him, “how much they resemble you!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.7#Thénardier, to whom avatars were easy, seized this occasion to become ondrette. His two daughters and Gavroche had hardly had time to discover that hey had two little brothers. When a certain degree of misery is reached, one is verpowered with a sort of spectral indifference, and one regards human beings s though they were spectres. Your nearest relations are often no more for you han vague shadowy forms, barely outlined against a nebulous background of life nd easily confounded again with the invisible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.8#On the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones to agnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, the Thénardier had elt, or had appeared to feel, a scruple. She said to her husband: “But this is bandoning our children!” Thénardier, masterful and phlegmatic, cauterized the cruple with this saying: “Jean Jacques Rousseau did even better!” From cruples, the mother proceeded to uneasiness: “But what if the police were to nnoy us? Tell me, Monsieur Thénardier, is what we have done permissible?” hénardier replied: “Everything is permissible. No one will see anything but rue blue in it. Besides, no one has any interest in looking closely after hildren who have not a sou.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.9#Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was areful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished in an ffected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized English thief. This nglish woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne, recommended by very ealthy relations, intimately connected with the medals in the Library and ademoiselle Mar’s diamonds, became celebrated later on in judicial accounts. he was called _Mamselle Miss_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.10#The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason to omplain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were well cared or, as is everything from which profit is derived; they were neither badly lothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like “little gentlemen,”—better y their false mother than by their real one. Magnon played the lady, and talked o thieves’ slang in their presence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.11#Thus passed several years. Thénardier augured well from the fact. One day, e chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs: The father must give them some education.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.12#All at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time been rotected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly hurled into ife and forced to begin it for themselves.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.13#A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret, ecessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations, is a eritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter-society which pursues its xistence beneath public society; an adventure of this description entails all orts of catastrophes in that sombre world. The Thénardier catastrophe involved he catastrophe of Magnon.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.14#One day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Éponine the note relating o the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police in the Rue Clocheperce; agnon was seized, as was also Mamselle Miss; and all the inhabitants of the ouse, which was of a suspicious character, were gathered into the net. While his was going on, the two little boys were playing in the back yard, and saw othing of the raid. When they tried to enter the house again, they found the oor fastened and the house empty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, and elivered to them a paper which “their mother” had left for them. On this paper here was an address: _M. Barge, collector of rents, Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No_. . The proprietor of the stall said to them: “You cannot live here any longer. o there. It is nearby. The first street on the left. Ask your way from this aper.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.15#The children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in his and the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbed little ingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a very good hold on he paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of wind tore it from im, and as night was falling, the child was not able to find it again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.1.16#They began to wander aimlessly through the streets.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.head#CHAPTER II—IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THE REAT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.1#Spring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do ot precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden the most eautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which enter warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or window. It seems as hough the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar, and as though the wind were ouring through it. In the spring of 1832, the epoch when the first great pidemic of this century broke out in Europe, these north gales were more harsh nd piercing than ever. It was a door even more glacial than that of winter hich was ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one felt the reath of the cholera.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.2#From a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed this eculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension. Frequent torms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, burst forth at this epoch.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.3#One evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree that anuary seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks, ittle Gavroche, who was always shivering gayly under his rags, was standing as hough in ecstasy before a wig-maker’s shop in the vicinity of the rme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman’s woollen shawl, picked up no ne knows where, and which he had converted into a neck comforter. Little avroche appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of a wax bride, in a ow-necked dress, and crowned with orange-flowers, who was revolving in the indow, and displaying her smile to passers-by, between two argand lamps; but in eality, he was taking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether e could not “prig” from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then roceed to sell for a sou to a “hair-dresser” in the suburbs. He had often anaged to breakfast off of such a roll. He called his species of work, for hich he possessed special aptitude, “shaving barbers.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.4#While contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he muttered etween his teeth: “Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Perhaps it was uesday. Yes, it was Tuesday.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.5#No one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.6#Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last occasion n which he had dined, three days before, for it was now Friday.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.7#The barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving a ustomer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, that freezing and mpudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets, but whose mind as evidently unsheathed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.8#While Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of windsor oap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and still smaller han himself, one apparently about seven years of age, the other five, timidly urned the handle and entered the shop, with a request for something or other, lms possibly, in a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a rayer. They both spoke at once, and their words were unintelligible because obs broke the voice of the younger, and the teeth of the elder were chattering ith cold. The barber wheeled round with a furious look, and without abandoning is razor, thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his nee, and slammed his door, saying: “The idea of coming in and freezing verybody for nothing!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.9#The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloud had isen; it had begun to rain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.10#Little Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.11#“What’s the matter with you, brats?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.12#“We don’t know where we are to sleep,” replied the elder.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.13#“Is that all?” said Gavroche. “A great matter, truly. The idea of bawling bout that. They must be greenies!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.14#And adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather bantering, n accent of tender authority and gentle patronage:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.15#“Come along with me, young ‘uns!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.16#“Yes, sir,” said the elder.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.17#And the two children followed him as they would have followed an rchbishop. They had stopped crying.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.18#Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of the astille.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.19#As Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at the arber’s shop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.20#“That fellow has no heart, the whiting,"35 he muttered. “He’s an nglishman.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.21#A woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, with Gavroche t their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh was wanting in respect owards the group.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.22#“Good day, Mamselle Omnibus,” said Gavroche to her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.23#An instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and he dded:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.24#“I am making a mistake in the beast; he’s not a whiting, he’s a serpent. arber, I’ll go and fetch a locksmith, and I’ll have a bell hung to your ail.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.25#This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over a gutter, he postrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on the Brocken, nd who had a broom in her hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.26#“Madam,” said he, “so you are going out with your horse?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.27#And thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.28#“You scamp!” shouted the furious pedestrian.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.29#Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.30#“Is Monsieur complaining?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.31#“Of you!” ejaculated the man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.32#“The office is closed,” said Gavroche, “I do not receive any more omplaints.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.33#In the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a beggar-girl, hirteen or fourteen years old, and clad in so short a gown that her knees were isible, lying thoroughly chilled under a porte-cochère. The little girl was etting to be too old for such a thing. Growth does play these tricks. The etticoat becomes short at the moment when nudity becomes indecent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.34#“Poor girl!” said Gavroche. “She hasn’t even trousers. Hold on, take his.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.35#And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck, he lung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where the scarf ecame a shawl once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.36#The child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl in ilence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery, the oor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returns thanks for good.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.37#That done: “Brrr!” said Gavroche, who was shivering more than Saint artin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.38#At this _brrr!_ the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became urious. The wicked skies punish good deeds.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.39#“Ah, come now!” exclaimed Gavroche, “what’s the meaning of this? It’s e-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop my ubscription.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.40#And he set out on the march once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.41#“It’s all right,” he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, as she oiled up under the shawl, “she’s got a famous peel.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.42#And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.43#“Caught!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.44#The two children followed close on his heels.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.45#As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate a aker’s shop, for bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turned ound:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.46#“Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.47#“Monsieur,” replied the elder, “we have had nothing to eat since this orning.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.48#“So you have neither father nor mother?” resumed Gavroche ajestically.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.49#“Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we don’t know where they re.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.50#“Sometimes that’s better than knowing where they are,” said Gavroche, who as a thinker.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.51#“We have been wandering about these two hours,” continued the elder, “we ave hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have found othing.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.52#“I know,” ejaculated Gavroche, “it’s the dogs who eat everything.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.53#He went on, after a pause:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.54#“Ah! we have lost our authors. We don’t know what we have done with them. his should not be, gamins. It’s stupid to let old people stray off like that. ome now! we must have a snooze all the same.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.55#However, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that they hould have no dwelling place!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.56#The elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered the rompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.57#“It’s queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get a lessed spray on Palm Sunday.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.58#“Bosh,” said Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.59#“Mamma,” resumed the elder, “is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.60#“Tanflûte!” retorted Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.61#Meanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had been feeling nd fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.62#At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied, ut which was triumphant, in reality.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.63#“Let us be calm, young ‘uns. Here’s supper for three.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.64#And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.65#Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both of hem before him into the baker’s shop, and flung his sou on the counter, rying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.66#“Boy! five centimes’ worth of bread.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.67#The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a nife.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.69#And he added with dignity:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.70#“There are three of us.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.71#And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, had aken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation s imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great Frederick’s snuff on the ip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the baker’s ace:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.72#“Keksekça?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.73#Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation f Gavroche’s to the baker a Russian or a Polish word, or one of those savage ries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other from bank to bank of river, athwart the solitudes, are warned that it is a word which they [our eaders] utter every day, and which takes the place of the phrase: “Qu’est-ce ue c’est que cela?” The baker understood perfectly, and replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.74#“Well! It’s bread, and very good bread of the second quality.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.75#“You mean _larton brutal_ [black bread]!” retorted Gavroche, calmly and oldly disdainful. “White bread, boy! white bread [_larton savonné_]! I’m tanding treat.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.76#The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he urveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.77#“Come, now, baker’s boy!” said he, “what are you taking our measure like hat for?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.78#All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.79#When the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, and avroche said to the two children:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.83#“Ah! hullo, that’s so! they don’t understand yet, they’re too small.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.84#And he repeated:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.86#At the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.87#And thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy of his onversation, deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from ll hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, as he handed him the largest hare:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.89#One piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.90#The poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore their read apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the baker, who, now hat they had paid their money, looked angrily at them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.91#“Let’s go into the street again,” said Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.92#They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.93#From time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the smallest alted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck y a cord.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.95#Then, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.96#“All the same, if I had charge of the babes I’d lock ‘em up better than hat.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.97#Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached the ngle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the low and hreatening wicket of La Force was visible:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.100#A man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other than ontparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable to avroche.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.169#He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than wo quills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils. This gave im a different nose.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.171#Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.173#The sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, Montparnasse ad become unrecognizable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.174#“Oh! Do play Porrichinelle for us!” exclaimed Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.175#The two children, who had not been listening up to this point, being ccupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drew near at this ame, and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.176#Unfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.177#He laid his hand on Gavroche’s shoulder, and said to him, emphasizing his ords: “Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square with my dog, my nife, and my wife, and if you were to squander ten sous on me, I wouldn’t efuse to work, but this isn’t Shrove Tuesday.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.178#This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeled round astily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention, and erceived a police sergeant standing with his back to them a few paces off. avroche allowed an: “Ah! good!” to escape him, but immediately suppressed it, nd shaking Montparnasse’s hand:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.179#“Well, good evening,” said he, “I’m going off to my elephant with my rats. Supposing that you should need me some night, you can come and hunt me up here. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You will inquire for onsieur Gavroche.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.180#“Very good,” said Montparnasse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.181#And they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the rève, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five, dragged along y his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned his head back several times o watch “Porrichinelle” as he went.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.182#The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche f the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than the assonance dig_ repeated five or six times in different forms. This syllable, _dig_, ttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase, means: “Take are, we can no longer talk freely.” There was besides, in Montparnasse’s entence, a literary beauty which was lost upon Gavroche, that is _mon dogue, ma ague et ma digue_, a slang expression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my nife, and my wife, greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great entury when Molière wrote and Callot drew.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.183#Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of he Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in the ancient itch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which has already been ffaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved to leave some trace, or it was the idea of a “member of the Institute, the General-in-chief of the rmy of Egypt.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.184#We say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this model tself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea of Napoleon’s, hich successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown, on each occasion, till further from us, had become historical and had acquired a certain efiniteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect. It was an elephant orty feet high, constructed of timber and masonry, bearing on its back a tower hich resembled a house, formerly painted green by some dauber, and now painted lack by heaven, the wind, and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of he place, the broad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower, his normous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at night, under the tarry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort of symbol of opular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It was some mighty, isible phantom, one knew not what, standing erect beside the invisible spectre f the Bastille.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.185#Few strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. It was alling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself from its ides formed hideous wounds upon it. “The ædiles,” as the expression ran in legant dialect, had forgotten it ever since 1814. There it stood in its corner, elancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded by a rotten palisade, soiled continually y drunken coachmen; cracks meandered athwart its belly, a lath projected from ts tail, tall grass flourished between its legs; and, as the level of the place ad been rising all around it for a space of thirty years, by that slow and ontinuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns, it stood n a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it. It as unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois, elancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was something about it of the dirt hich is on the point of being swept out, and something of the majesty which is n the point of being decapitated. As we have said, at night, its aspect hanged. Night is the real element of everything that is dark. As soon as wilight descended, the old elephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil nd redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows. Being of he past, he belonged to night; and obscurity was in keeping with his randeur.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.186#This rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, but assuredly ajestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity, has isappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of gigantic stove, ornamented ith its pipe, which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine towers, very uch as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes. It is quite natural that a tove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power. This epoch ill pass away, people have already begun to understand that, if there can be orce in a boiler, there can be no force except in the brain; in other words, hat which leads and drags on the world, is not locomotives, but ideas. Harness ocomotives to ideas,—that is well done; but do not mistake the horse for the ider.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.187#At all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect of his elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; the architect of he stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of bronze.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.188#This stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, and called he column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried, was still nveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, which we regret, for our art, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed the task of isolating the lephant.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.189#It was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflection f a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two “brats.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.190#The reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him hat we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, the ribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage, and utilation of a public monument, a child who had been caught asleep in this very lephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.191#On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the ffect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small, and aid:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.193#Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant’s enclosure nd helped the young ones to clamber through the breach.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.194#There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served the aborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with remarkable igor, and placed it against one of the elephant’s forelegs. Near the point here the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could e distinguished.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.201#He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, without eigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. He entered it s an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared within, and an instant ater, the two children saw his head, which looked pale, appear vaguely, on the dge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitish spectre.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.202#“Well!” he exclaimed, “climb up, young ‘uns! You’ll see how snug it is ere! Come up, you!” he said to the elder, “I’ll lend you a hand.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.204#The elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the ladder; avroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations like a encing-master to his pupils, or a muleteer to his mules.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.210#And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped down he elephant’s leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his feet in the rass, grasped the child of five round the body, and planted him fairly in the iddle of the ladder, then he began to climb up behind him, shouting to the lder:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.217#Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things! Goodness f giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of the Emperor’s, had ecome the box of a street urchin. The brat had been accepted and sheltered by he colossus. The bourgeois decked out in their Sunday finery who passed the lephant of the Bastille, were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully ith their prominent eyes: “What’s the good of that?” It served to save from the old, the frost, the hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to reserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in the now which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother, no read, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom society epulsed. It served to diminish public crime. It was a lair open to one against hom all doors were shut. It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon, nvaded by vermin and oblivion, covered with warts, with mould, and ulcers, ottering, worm-eaten, abandoned, condemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, sking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the crossroads, had aken pity on that other mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to is feet, without a roof over his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, ed on rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good for. his idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back by God. That which ad been merely illustrious, had become august. In order to realize his thought, he Emperor should have had porphyry, brass, iron, gold, marble; the old ollection of planks, beams and plaster sufficed for God. The Emperor had had he dream of a genius; in that Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk plifted, bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying aters, he wished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with it, e had lodged a child there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.218#The hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly isible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated, beneath the lephant’s belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who ould pass through it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.219#“Let’s begin,” said Gavroche, “by telling the porter that we are not at ome.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.220#And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well cquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up the aperture.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.221#Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard the rackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemical match was ot yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steel represented progress.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.222#A sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one f those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called _cellar rats_. The cellar rat_, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the interior of the lephant confusedly visible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.223#Gavroche’s two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which they xperienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in the great un of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must have felt in the iblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping hem. Above, a long brown beam, whence started at regular distances, massive, rching ribs, represented the vertebral column with its sides, stalactites of laster depended from them like entrails, and vast spiders’ webs stretching from ide to side, formed dirty diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were isible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive, and which hanged places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement.

Outside it’s raining, here it does ot rain; outside it’s cold, here there’s not an atom of wind; outside there are eaps of people, here there’s no one; outside there ain’t even the moon, here here’s my candle, confound it!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.232#The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; but avroche allowed them no more time for contemplation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.233#“Quick,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.234#And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the nd of the room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.235#There stood his bed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.236#Gavroche’s bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, a lanket, and an alcove with curtains.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.237#The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of gray oollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove consisted f:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.238#Three rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbish hich formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two in front nd one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as to form a pyramidal undle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of brass wire which was simply laced upon it, but artistically applied, and held by fastenings of iron wire, o that it enveloped all three holes. A row of very heavy stones kept this etwork down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it. This grating was othing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered n menageries. Gavroche’s bed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The whole esembled an Esquimaux tent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.239#This trellis-work took the place of curtains.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.240#Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front, and he two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.241#“Down on all fours, brats!” said Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.242#He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawled n after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the opening hermetically gain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.243#All three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the _cellar at_ in his hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.244#“Now,” said he, “go to sleep! I’m going to suppress the candelabra.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.245#“Monsieur,” the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to the etting, “what’s that for?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.246#“That,” answered Gavroche gravely, “is for the rats. Go to sleep!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.247#Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the enefit of these young creatures, and he continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.248#“It’s a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It’s used for fierce animals. here’s a whole shopful of them there. All you’ve got to do is to climb over a all, crawl through a window, and pass through a door. You can get as much as ou want.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.249#As he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the lanket, and the little one murmured:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.250#“Oh! how good that is! It’s warm!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.251#Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.252#“That’s from the Jardin des Plantes, too,” said he. “I took that from the onkeys.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.253#And, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a very hick and admirably made mat, he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.254#“That belonged to the giraffe.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.255#After a pause he went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.256#“The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn’t rouble them. I told them: ‘It’s for the elephant.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.257#He paused, and then resumed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.258#“You crawl over the walls and you don’t care a straw for the government. o there now!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.259#The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepid nd ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolated like themselves, frail ike themselves, who had something admirable and all-powerful about him, who eemed supernatural to them, and whose physiognomy was composed of all the rimaces of an old mountebank, mingled with the most ingenuous and charming miles.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.260#“Monsieur,” ventured the elder timidly, “you are not afraid of the olice, then?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.261#Gavroche contented himself with replying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.262#“Brat! Nobody says ‘police,’ they say ‘bobbies.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.263#The smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing. As he was on the dge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked the blanket ound him as a mother might have done, and heightened the mat under his head ith old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for the child. Then he turned o the elder:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.264#“Hey! We’re jolly comfortable here, ain’t we?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.265#“Ah, yes!” replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression of a aved angel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.266#The two poor little children who had been soaked through, began to grow arm once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.267#“Ah, by the way,” continued Gavroche, “what were you bawling about?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.268#And pointing out the little one to his brother:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.269#“A mite like that, I’ve nothing to say about, but the idea of a big ellow like you crying! It’s idiotic; you looked like a calf.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.270#“Gracious,” replied the child, “we have no lodging.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.271#“Bother!” retorted Gavroche, “you don’t say ‘lodgings,’ you say crib.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.272#“And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.273#“You don’t say ‘night,’ you say ‘darkmans.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.274#“Thank you, sir,” said the child.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.275#“Listen,” went on Gavroche, “you must never bawl again over anything. ’ll take care of you. You shall see what fun we’ll have. In summer, we’ll go to he Glacière with Navet, one of my pals, we’ll bathe in the Gare, we’ll run tark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz,—that makes the aundresses raging. They scream, they get mad, and if you only knew how idiculous they are! We’ll go and see the man-skeleton. And then I’ll take you o the play. I’ll take you to see Frédérick Lemaître. I have tickets, I know ome of the actors, I even played in a piece once. There were a lot of us ellers, and we ran under a cloth, and that made the sea. I’ll get you an ngagement at my theatre. We’ll go to see the savages. They ain’t real, those avages ain’t. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see here their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we’ll go to the Opera. e’ll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well managed. I ouldn’t associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the Opera, just fancy! ome of them pay twenty sous, but they’re ninnies. They’re called dishclouts. nd then we’ll go to see the guillotine work. I’ll show you the executioner. He ives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. h! we’ll have famous fun!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.276#At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche’s finger, and recalled him o the realities of life.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.277#“The deuce!” said he, “there’s the wick giving out. Attention! I can’t pend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed, he must leep. We haven’t the time to read M. Paul de Kock’s romances. And besides, the ight might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochère, and all the bobbies eed to do is to see it.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.278#“And then,” remarked the elder timidly,—he alone dared talk to Gavroche, nd reply to him, “a spark might fall in the straw, and we must look out and not urn the house down.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.279#“People don’t say ‘burn the house down,’” remarked Gavroche, “they say blaze the crib.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.280#The storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon the ack of the colossus amid claps of thunder. “You’re taken in, rain!” said avroche. “It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house. inter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it loses its labor, it can’t wet s, and that makes it kick up a row, old water-carrier that it is.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.281#This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche, in is character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted, was followed y a broad flash of lightning, so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly f the elephant through the crack. Almost at the same instant, the thunder umbled with great fury. The two little creatures uttered a shriek, and started p so eagerly that the network came near being displaced, but Gavroche turned is bold face to them, and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a augh.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.282#“Calm down, children. Don’t topple over the edifice. That’s fine, irst-class thunder; all right. That’s no slouch of a streak of lightning. Bravo or the good God! Deuce take it! It’s almost as good as it is at the mbigu.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.283#That said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two children ently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch them out at ull length, and exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.284#“Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now, abes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. It’s very bad not to leep. It’ll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, in fashionable ociety, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in the hide! I’m going to ut out the light. Are you ready?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.285#“Yes,” murmured the elder, “I’m all right. I seem to have feathers under y head.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.286#“People don’t say ‘head,’” cried Gavroche, “they say ‘nut’.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.287#The two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished arranging hem on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then repeated, for the hird time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.288#“Shut your peepers!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.289#And he snuffed out his tiny light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.290#Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling began o affect the netting under which the three children lay.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.291#It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic ound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This was ccompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.292#The little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and hilled with terror, jogged his brother’s elbow; but the elder brother had lready shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the little one, who ould no longer control his terror, questioned Gavroche, but in a very low tone, nd with bated breath:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.293#“Sir?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.294#“Hey?” said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.295#“What is that?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.296#“It’s the rats,” replied Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.297#And he laid his head down on the mat again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.298#The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the lephant, and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned, ad been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as it had been lighted; ut as soon as the cavern, which was the same as their city, had returned to arkness, scenting what the good story-teller Perrault calls “fresh meat,” they ad hurled themselves in throngs on Gavroche’s tent, had climbed to the top of t, and had begun to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this ew-fangled trap.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.299#Still the little one could not sleep.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.300#“Sir?” he began again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.301#“Hey?” said Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.302#“What are rats?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.303#“They are mice.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.304#This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice in he course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless, he lifted p his voice once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.305#“Sir?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.306#“Hey?” said Gavroche again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.307#“Why don’t you have a cat?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.308#“I did have one,” replied Gavroche, “I brought one here, but they ate er.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.309#This second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little ellow began to tremble again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.310#The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth ime:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.311#“Monsieur?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.312#“Hey?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.313#“Who was it that was eaten?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.315#“And who ate the cat?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.316#“The rats.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.317#“The mice?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.318#“Yes, the rats.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.319#The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which ate ats, pursued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.320#“Sir, would those mice eat us?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.321#“Wouldn’t they just!” ejaculated Gavroche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.322#The child’s terror had reached its climax. But Gavroche added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.323#“Don’t be afraid. They can’t get in. And besides, I’m here! Here, catch old of my hand. Hold your tongue and shut your peepers!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.324#At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow’s hand across his rother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured. Courage nd strength have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves. Silence eigned round them once more, the sound of their voices had frightened off the ats; at the expiration of a few minutes, they came raging back, but in vain, he three little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.325#The hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de la astille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts, the patrol earched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure nooks, and in their earch for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant; the onster, erect, motionless, staring open-eyed into the shadows, had the ppearance of dreaming happily over his good deed; and sheltered from heaven and rom men the three poor sleeping children.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.326#In order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must remember, hat, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated at the other end of he square, and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could either be seen nor heard by the sentinel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.327#Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a man urned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of the enclosure of he column of July, and glided between the palings until he was underneath the elly of the elephant. If any light had illuminated that man, it might have been ivined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the ight in the rain. Arrived beneath the elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, hich did not belong to any human tongue, and which a paroquet alone could have mitated. Twice he repeated this cry, of whose orthography the following barely onveys an idea:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.328#“Kirikikiou!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.329#At the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly f the elephant:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.330#“Yes!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.331#Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside, and ave passage to a child who descended the elephant’s leg, and fell briskly near he man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.332#As for his cry of _Kirikikiou_,—that was, doubtless, what the child had eant, when he said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.333#“You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.334#On hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his alcove,” pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing it together gain, then he had opened the trap, and descended.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.335#The man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom: ontparnasse confined himself to the remark:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.336#“We need you. Come, lend us a hand.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.337#The lad asked for no further enlightenment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.338#“I’m with you,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.339#And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence ontparnasse had emerged, winding rapidly through the long file of arket-gardeners’ carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.2.340#The market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid the alads and vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers on account f the beating rain, did not even glance at these strange pedestrians.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.head#CHAPTER III—THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.1#This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.2#An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, and Thénardier, lthough Thénardier was in close confinement. Babet had arranged the matter for is own benefit, on the same day, as the reader has seen from Montparnasse’s ccount to Gavroche. Montparnasse was to help them from outside.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.3#Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had time, n the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a plan. In former imes, those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the onvict into his own hands, were composed of four stone walls, a stone ceiling, flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated window, and a door lined with iron, and ere called _dungeons_; but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays hey are composed of an iron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a flagged avement, four stone walls, and a stone ceiling, and are called _chambers of unishment_. A little light penetrates towards midday. The inconvenient point bout these chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that they llow the persons who should be at work to think.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.4#So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a ope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne courtyard, e was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found in the New Building as Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, that is to say, crime; a nail, hat is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it is high time that the reader should ave a complete idea, was, with an appearance of delicate health and a rofoundly premeditated languor, a polished, intelligent sprig, and a thief, who ad a caressing glance, and an atrocious smile. His glance resulted from his ill, and his smile from his nature. His first studies in his art had been irected to roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men who ear off lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process alled _double pickings_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.5#The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly avorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-laying and e-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on the prison. The aint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the Charlemagne nd the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there were scaffoldings and ladders; in ther words, bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.6#The New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen nywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls were eaten by altpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the aults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood, because stones were in the abit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds. In spite f this antiquity, the authorities committed the error of confining in the New uilding the most troublesome prisoners, of placing there “the hard cases,” as hey say in prison parlance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.7#The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and a top tory which was called the Bel-Air (Fine-Air). A large chimney-flue, probably rom some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force, started from the ground loor, traversed all four stories, cut the dormitories, where it figured as a lattened pillar, into two portions, and finally pierced the roof.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.8#Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, by ay of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the heads of their eds should rest against the chimney.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.9#Thénardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as ine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, after assing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochère of the athing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden oxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two ings, brightened up with green shutters, the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.6.3.10#Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormous lack, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.

There stood on that spot, in the ast century, a house of which only the back wall now remains, a regular wall of asonry, which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining uildings. This ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are till to be seen there; the middle one, that nearest the right gable, is barred ith a worm-eaten beam adjusted like a prop.

But n that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an mpossibility. Had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof f the Fine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the coping f the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut? But the uter wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line; it mounted and escended, it dropped at the firemen’s barracks, it rose towards the bath-house, t was cut in twain by buildings, it was not even of the same height on the otel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavée; everywhere occurred falls and right angles; nd then, the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, he route taken by Thénardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, light was impossible. Had Thénardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty hich changes precipices into ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, a egless man into an athlete, a gouty man into a bird, stupidity into instinct, nstinct into intelligence, and intelligence into genius, had Thénardier nvented a third mode? No one has ever found out.

The sound of doors opening and shutting, the creaking of ratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the hoarse shouts of the urnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the pavement of the courts, reached his ars. Lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories, torch ran along the ridge-pole of the top story of the New Building, the iremen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned. Their helmets, hich the torch lighted up in the rain, went and came along the roofs.

Here this man was joined by a second, who walked with the ame caution, then by a third, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, ne of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered the nclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under Thénardier. hese men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might onsult without being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards the icket of La Force a few paces distant. It must be added, that the rain kept his sentinel blocked in his box. Thénardier, not being able to distinguish heir visages, lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a retch who feels himself lost.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.6#What is slang? It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect; it s theft in its two kinds; people and language.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.7#When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombre istory introduced into a work written with the same aim as this39 a thief who alked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.—“What!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.8#We have never understood this sort of objections.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.9#Since that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound observer f the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the people, Balzac and ugène Sue, having represented their ruffians as talking their natural language, s the author of _The Last Day of a Condemned Man_ did in 1828, the same bjections have been raised. People repeated: “What do authors mean by that evolting dialect? Slang is odious! Slang makes one shudder!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.10#Who denies that? Of course it does.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.11#When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when as it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We have always hought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least, a simple and seful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and ulfilled merits. Why should one not explore everything, and study everything? hy should one halt on the way? The halt is a matter depending on the ounding-line, and not on the leadsman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.12#Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertake n investigation into the lowest depths of the social order, where terra firma omes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage in those vague, murky waves, to ollow up, to seize and to fling, still quivering, upon the pavement that abject ialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light, that ustulous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of he mire and the shadows. Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus n its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang. t seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has ust been torn from its cesspool. One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, nd bristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, hreatens and glares. One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished and leeding eye, such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab. All his is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out f disorganization.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.13#Now, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady banished edicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper, the bat, the corpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who would cast them back into heir darkness, saying: “Oh! how ugly that is!” The thinker who should turn side from slang would resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an lcer or a wart. He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in anguage, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. For, it ust be stated to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a iterary phenomenon and a social result. What is slang, properly speaking? It is he language of wretchedness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.14#We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is ne way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions, it may e added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of ntelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who says: “Montpellier not ctive, Marseilles fine quality,” the broker on ‘change who says: “Assets at end f current month,” the gambler who says: _“Tiers et tout, refait de pique,”_ the heriff of the Norman Isles who says: “The holder in fee reverting to his landed state cannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of he real estate by the mortgagor,” the playwright who says: “The piece was issed,” the comedian who says: “I’ve made a hit,” the philosopher who says: Phenomenal triplicity,” the huntsman who says: _“Voileci allais, Voileci uyant,”_ the phrenologist who says: “Amativeness, combativeness, ecretiveness,” the infantry soldier who says: “My shooting-iron,” the avalry-man who says: “My turkey-cock,” the fencing-master who says: “Tierce, uarte, break,” the printer who says: “My shooting-stick and galley,”—all, rinter, fencing-master, cavalry dragoon, infantry-man, phrenologist, huntsman, hilosopher, comedian, playwright, sheriff, gambler, stock-broker, and merchant, peak slang. The painter who says: “My grinder,” the notary who says: “My kip-the-Gutter,” the hairdresser who says: “My mealyback,” the cobbler who ays: “My cub,” talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on the oint, all the different fashions of saying the right and the left, the sailor’s port_ and _starboard_, the scene-shifter’s _court-side_, and _garden-side_, the eadle’s _Gospel-side_ and _Epistle-side_, are slang. There is the slang of the ffected lady as well as of the _précieuses_. The Hotel Rambouillet nearly djoins the Cour des Miracles. There is a slang of duchesses, witness this hrase contained in a love-letter from a very great lady and a very pretty woman f the Restoration: “You will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why I hould libertize."40 Diplomatic ciphers are slang; the pontifical chancellery by sing 26 for Rome, _grkztntgzyal_ for despatch, and _abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI_. or the Duc de Modena, speaks slang. The physicians of the Middle Ages who, for arrot, radish, and turnip, said _Opoponach, perfroschinum, reptitalmus, racatholicum, angelorum, postmegorum_, talked slang. The sugar-manufacturer who ays: “Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,”—this honest manufacturer alks slang. A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, which used to say: Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,”—talked lang. The poet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would esignate M. de Montmorency as “a bourgeois,” if he were not a judge of verses nd statues, speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers “Flora,” ruits, “Pomona,” the sea, “Neptune,” love, “fires,” beauty, “charms,” a horse, a courser,” the white or tricolored cockade, “the rose of Bellona,” the hree-cornered hat, “Mars’ triangle,”—that classical Academician talks slang. lgebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang. The tongue which is employed n board ship, that wonderful language of the sea, which is so complete and so icturesque, which was spoken by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperré, hich mingles with the whistling of the rigging, the sound of the peaking-trumpets, the shock of the boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the ind, the gale, the cannon, is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to he fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.15#No doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding the word slang_ is an extension which every one will not admit. For our part, we reserve o the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and determined significance, nd we restrict slang to slang. The veritable slang and the slang that is re-eminently slang, if the two words can be coupled thus, the slang immemorial hich was a kingdom, is nothing else, we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, rafty, treacherous, venomous, cruel, equivocal, vile, profound, fatal tongue of retchedness. There exists, at the extremity of all abasement and all isfortunes, a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into onflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights; a fearful onflict, where, now cunning, now violent, unhealthy and ferocious at one and he same time, it attacks the social order with pin-pricks through vice, and ith club-blows through crime. To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness as invented a language of combat, which is slang.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.16#To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were t but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would, therwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which ivilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend the records f social observation; is to serve civilization itself. This service Plautus endered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk hœnician; that service Molière rendered, by making so many of his characters alk Levantine and all sorts of dialects. Here objections spring up afresh. hœnician, very good! Levantine, quite right! Even dialect, let that pass! They re tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang! What is the se of preserving slang? What is the good of assisting slang “to survive”?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.17#To this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which a ation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language which has een spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.18#It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for more han four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible human isery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.19#And then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities and nfirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy, is not a usiness in which choice is permitted. The historian of manners and ideas has no ess austere a mission than the historian of events. The latter has the surface f civilization, the conflicts of crowns, the births of princes, the marriages f kings, battles, assemblages, great public men, revolutions in the daylight, verything on the exterior; the other historian has the interior, the depths, he people who toil, suffer, wait, the oppressed woman, the agonizing child, the ecret war between man and man, obscure ferocities, prejudices, plotted niquities, the subterranean, the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the ie-of-hunger, the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of souls, the o-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans, the unhappy, and he infamous, all the forms which roam through the darkness. He must descend ith his heart full of charity, and severity at the same time, as a brother and s a judge, to those impenetrable casemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who leed and those who deal the blow, those who weep and those who curse, those who ast and those who devour, those who endure evil and those who inflict it. Have hese historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of xternal facts? Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say han Machiavelli? Is the under side of civilization any less important than the pper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre? Do we really know the ountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.1.20#Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what recedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of istorians which does not exist in our mind. No one is a good historian of the atent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples, if he is not, at the same ime, in a certain measure, the historian of their deep and hidden life; and no ne is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how, at need, to e the historian of the exterior also. The history of manners and ideas ermeates the history of events, and this is true reciprocally. They constitute wo different orders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always nterlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineaments which rovidence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but istinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions n the surface. True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian ingles in everything.

Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon rime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil. It no onger walks, it hobbles; it limps on the crutch of the Court of Miracles, a rutch metamorphosable into a club; it is called vagrancy; every sort of pectre, its dressers, have painted its face, it crawls and rears, the double ait of the reptile. Henceforth, it is apt at all rôles, it is made suspicious y the counterfeiter, covered with verdigris by the forger, blacked by the soot f the incendiary; and the murderer applies its rouge.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.2#Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy is bidden to ts most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmatic dialect at once o blighted and rebellious. Therein lies chastisement made visible. Every yllable has an air of being marked. The words of the vulgar tongue appear herein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were, beneath the hot iron of the xecutioner. Some seem to be still smoking. Such and such a phrase produces upon ou the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the fleur-de-lys, which as suddenly been laid bare. Ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these ubstantives which are fugitives from justice. Metaphor is sometimes so hameless, that one feels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.3#Moreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strange ialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial case of igeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold edal, and which is called literature. Slang, whether the public admit the fact r not has its syntax and its poetry. It is a language. Yes, by the deformity of ertain terms, we recognize the fact that it was chewed by Mandrin, and by the plendor of certain metonymies, we feel that Villon spoke it.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.6#is a verse of slang. _Antan—ante annum_—is a word of Thunes slang, which ignified the past year, and by extension, _formerly_. Thirty-five years ago, at he epoch of the departure of the great chain-gang, there could be read in one f the cells at Bicêtre, this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king f Thunes condemned to the galleys: _Les dabs d’antan trimaient siempre pour la ierre du Coësre_. This means _Kings in days gone by always went and had hemselves anointed_. In the opinion of that king, anointment meant the alleys.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.7#The word _décarade_, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at a allop, is attributed to Villon, and it is worthy of him. This word, which trikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a masterly onomatopœia the hole of La Fontaine’s admirable verse:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.8#Six forts chevaux tiraient un coche. Six stout horses drew a coach.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.9#From a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove more curious nd fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole language within a language, sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft which has produced a egetation, a parasite which has its roots in the old Gallic trunk, and whose inister foliage crawls all over one side of the language. This is what may be alled the first, the vulgar aspect of slang. But, for those who study the ongue as it should be studied, that is to say, as geologists study the earth, lang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit. According as one digs a longer r shorter distance into it, one finds in slang, below the old popular French, rovençal, Spanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the Mediterranean orts, English and German, the Romance language in its three varieties, French, talian, and Romance Romance, Latin, and finally Basque and Celtic. A profound nd unique formation. A subterranean edifice erected in common by all the iserable. Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering has ropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its pebble. A throng of vil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversed life and have vanished into ternity, linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some onstrous word.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.10#Do you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. Here is boffete_, a box on the ear, which is derived from _bofeton; vantane_, window later on _vanterne_), which comes from _vantana; gat_, cat, which comes from gato; acite_, oil, which comes from _aceyte_. Do you want Italian? Here is spade_, sword, which comes from _spada; carvel_, boat, which comes from caravella_. Do you want English? Here is _bichot_, which comes from _bishop; aille_, spy, which comes from _rascal, rascalion; pilche_, a case, which comes rom _pilcher_, a sheath. Do you want German? Here is the _caleur_, the waiter, kellner_; the _hers_, the master, _herzog_ (duke). Do you want Latin? Here is frangir_, to break, _frangere; affurer_, to steal, _fur; cadene_, chain, catena_. There is one word which crops up in every language of the continent, ith a sort of mysterious power and authority. It is the word _magnus_; the cotchman makes of it his _mac_, which designates the chief of the clan; ac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the great Farlane, the great Callumore41; slang urns it into _meck_ and later _le meg_, that is to say, God. Would you like asque? Here is _gahisto_, the devil, which comes from _gaïztoa_, evil; sorgabon_, good night, which comes from _gabon_, good evening. Do you want eltic? Here is _blavin_, a handkerchief, which comes from _blavet_, gushing ater; _ménesse_, a woman (in a bad sense), which comes from _meinec_, full of tones; _barant_, brook, from _baranton_, fountain; _goffeur_, locksmith, from goff_, blacksmith; _guedouze_, death, which comes from _guenn-du_, black-white. inally, would you like history? Slang calls crowns _les maltèses_, a souvenir f the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.11#In addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possesses ther and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, from the mind of an itself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.12#In the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies the mystery f tongues. To paint with words, which contains figures one knows not how or hy, is the primitive foundation of all human languages, what may be called heir granite.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.13#Slang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, words created nstantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, without etymology, without nalogies, without derivatives, solitary, barbarous, sometimes hideous words, hich at times possess a singular power of expression and which live. The xecutioner, _le taule_; the forest, _le sabri_; fear, flight, _taf_; the ackey, _le larbin_; the mineral, the prefect, the minister, _pharos_; the evil, _le rabouin_. Nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and eveal. Some, _le rabouin_, for example, are at the same time grotesque and errible, and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.14#In the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is esirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures. etaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke, the prisoner ho is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom is more metaphorical than lang: _dévisser le coco_ (to unscrew the nut), to twist the neck; _tortiller_ to wriggle), to eat; _être gerbé_, to be tried; _a rat_, a bread thief; _il ansquine_, it rains, a striking, ancient figure which partly bears its date bout it, which assimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense and lanting pikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a single word the opular expression: it rains halberds. Sometimes, in proportion as slang rogresses from the first epoch to the second, words pass from the primitive and avage sense to the metaphorical sense. The devil ceases to be _le rabouin_, and ecomes _le boulanger_ (the baker), who puts the bread into the oven. This is ore witty, but less grand, something like Racine after Corneille, like uripides after Æschylus. Certain slang phrases which participate in the two pochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character esemble phantasmagories. _Les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails à la une_—the prowlers are going to steal horses by night,—this passes before the ind like a group of spectres. One knows not what one sees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.15#In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses it n accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it often confines tself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and summary fashion. ccasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed and complicated with words f pure slang, picturesque phrases are formed, in which there can be felt the ixture of the two preceding elements, the direct creation and the metaphor: _le ab jaspine, je marronne que la roulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri_, the dog s barking, I suspect that the diligence for Paris is passing through the woods. Le dab est sinve, la dabuge est merloussière, la fée est bative_, the bourgeois s stupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty. Generally, to hrow listeners off the track, slang confines itself to adding to all the words f the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in _aille_, n _orgue_, in _iergue_, or in _uche_. Thus: _Vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce igotmuche?_ Do you think that leg of mutton good? A phrase addressed by artouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his scape suited him.

Contrary to what happens with every other egetation, every ray of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches. hus slang is in constant process of decomposition and recomposition; an obscure nd rapid work which never pauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than language in ten centuries. Thus _le larton_ (bread) becomes _le lartif; le ail_ (horse) becomes _le gaye; la fertanche_ (straw) becomes _la fertille; le omignard_ (brat), _le momacque; les fiques_ (duds), _frusques; la chique_ (the hurch), _l‘égrugeoir; le colabre_ (neck), _le colas_. The devil is at first, gahisto_, then _le rabouin_, then _the baker_; the priest is a _ratichon_, then he boar (_le sanglier_); the dagger is _le vingt-deux_ (twenty-two), then _le urin_, then _le lingre_; the police are _railles_, then _roussins_, then rousses_, then _marchands de lacets_ (dealers in stay-laces), then _coquers_, hen _cognes_; the executioner is _le taule_, then _Charlot, l’atigeur_, then le becquillard_. In the seventeenth century, to fight was “to give each other nuff”; in the nineteenth it is “to chew each other’s throats.” There have been wenty different phrases between these two extremes. Cartouche’s talk would have een Hebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of this language are perpetually engaged n flight like the men who utter them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.18#Still, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement, the ncient slang crops up again and becomes new once more. It has its headquarters here it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved the slang of the seventeenth entury; Bicêtre, when it was a prison, preserved the slang of Thunes. There one ould hear the termination in _anche_ of the old Thuneurs. _Boyanches-tu_ bois-tu), do you drink? But perpetual movement remains its law, evertheless.

It had neither windows nor ir-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter there, air could not. his vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and for floor ten inches of mud. It as flagged; but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the ater. Eight feet above the floor, a long and massive beam traversed this ubterranean excavation from side to side; from this beam hung, at short istances apart, chains three feet long, and at the end of these chains there ere rings for the neck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the alleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They were hrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging in the arkness and waiting for him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.26#The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands, caught he unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and left there. As the hain was too short, they could not lie down. They remained motionless in that avern, in that night, beneath that beam, almost hanging, forced to unheard-of fforts to reach their bread, jug, or their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, ilth flowing to their very calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and nees giving way, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain ome rest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened every moment y the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In order to eat, they pushed he bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along their leg with their heel ntil it reached their hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.2.27#How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months ometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys. Men were ut there for stealing a hare from the king. In this sepulchre-hell, what did hey do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they went through the agonies of death, nd what can man do in hell, they sang; for song lingers where there is no onger any hope. In the waters of Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song ould be heard before the sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who ad gone through the prison-cellar of the Châtelet, said: “It was the rhymes hat kept me up.” Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme?

Commonplace metaphor eplies: “It is to see thirty-six candles.” Here slang intervenes and takes it p: Candle, _camoufle_.

Thus, by a sort of infiltration from below upwards, ith the aid of metaphor, that incalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the avern to the Academy; and Poulailler saying: “I light my _camoufle_,” causes oltaire to write: “Langleviel La Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets_.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.3.1#As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred years go, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre, symbolical spirit hich gives to all words a mien which is now mournful, now menacing. One feels n it the wild and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the Court of Miracles ho played at cards with packs of their own, some of which have come down to us. he eight of clubs, for instance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous refoil leaves, a sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot f this tree a fire was burning, over which three hares were roasting a huntsman n a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming pot, whence emerged he head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy than these reprisals in ainting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakes for the roasting of mugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters. The diverse orms assumed by thought in the realm of slang, even song, even raillery, even enace, all partook of this powerless and dejected character. All the songs, the elodies of some of which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the oint of evoking tears. The _pègre_ is always the poor _pègre_, and he is always he hare in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardly complains, he ontents himself with sighing; one of his moans has come down to us: “I do not nderstand how God, the father of men, can torture his children and his randchildren and hear them cry, without himself suffering torture."43 The retch, whenever he has time to think, makes himself small before the low, and rail in the presence of society; he lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he ppeals to the side of compassion; we feel that he is conscious of his uilt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.3.2#Towards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison songs nd thieves’ ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and jovial mien. The laintive _maluré_ was replaced by the _larifla_. We find in the eighteenth entury, in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons, a diabolical and nigmatical gayety. We hear this strident and lilting refrain which we should ay had been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam, and which seems to have been lung into the forest by a will-o’-the-wisp playing the fife:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.3.3#Miralabi suslababo Mirliton ribonribette Surlababi mirlababo Mirliton ibonribo.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.3.5#A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy of the ejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the _grand meg_ and he _grand dab_. Given Louis XV. they call the King of France “le Marquis de antin.” And behold, they are almost gay. A sort of gleam proceeds from these iserable wretches, as though their consciences were not heavy within them any ore. These lamentable tribes of darkness have no longer merely the desperate udacity of actions, they possess the heedless audacity of mind. A sign that hey are losing the sense of their criminality, and that they feel, even among hinkers and dreamers, some indefinable support which the latter themselves know ot of. A sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and ophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness, while ommunicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines. A sign, in short, of some utbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.3.6#Let us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenth entury? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth century is ealthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot at their head; the hysiocrates, Turgot at their head; the philosophers, Voltaire at their head; he Utopians, Rousseau at their head,—these are four sacred legions. Humanity’s mmense advance towards the light is due to them. They are the four vanguards of he human race, marching towards the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot owards the beautiful, Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, ousseau towards the just. But by the side of and above the philosophers, there ere the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth, hemlock n the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning the great books of the iberators of the century on the grand staircase of the court-house, writers now orgotten were publishing, with the King’s sanction, no one knows what strangely isorganizing writings, which were eagerly read by the unfortunate. Some of hese publications, odd to say, which were patronized by a prince, are to be ound in the Secret Library. These facts, significant but unknown, were mperceptible on the surface. Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks ts danger. It is obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one ho probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was Restif e La Bretonne.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.7.3.7#This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages in ermany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed up by chiller in his famous drama _The Robbers_, theft and pillage rose up in protest gainst property and labor, assimilated certain specious and false elementary deas, which, though just in appearance, were absurd in reality, enveloped hemselves in these ideas, disappeared within them, after a fashion, assumed an bstract name, passed into the state of theory, and in that shape circulated mong the laborious, suffering, and honest masses, unknown even to the imprudent hemists who had prepared the mixture, unknown even to the masses who accepted t. Whenever a fact of this sort presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering ngenders wrath; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall sleep, which is the same thing as shutting one’s eyes, the hatred of the nfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made spirit which reams in a corner, and sets itself to the scrutiny of society. The scrutiny of atred is a terrible thing.

Since ’89, the whole people has been dilating into a sublime ndividual; there is not a poor man, who, possessing his right, has not his ray f sun; the die-of-hunger feels within him the honesty of France; the dignity of he citizen is an internal armor; he who is free is scrupulous; he who votes eigns. Hence incorruptibility; hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence yes heroically lowered before temptations. The revolutionary wholesomeness is uch, that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August, there is o longer any populace. The first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs s: death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the ideal and the absolute do ot filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons containing the wealth of he Tuileries escorted in 1848? By the rag-pickers of the Faubourg aint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over the treasure.

We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort of terror that we look n, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind those colossal aves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, hebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the hadows. But shadows are there, and light is here. We are not acquainted with he maladies of these ancient civilizations, we do not know the infirmities of ur own. Everywhere upon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its eauties, we lay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness nce diagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy. Our ivilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and its prodigy; it is orth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It is already much to have olaced it; its enlightenment is yet another point. All the labors of modern ocial philosophies must converge towards this point. The thinker of to-day has great duty—to auscultate civilization.

Beneath the social mortality, we feel human mperishableness.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.head#CHAPTER I—FULL LIGHT
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.1#The reader has probably understood that Éponine, having recognized through he gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon had sent her, had egun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet, and had then conducted arius thither, and that, after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate, arius, drawn on by that force which draws the iron to the magnet and a lover owards the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves, had finally ntered Cosette’s garden as Romeo entered the garden of Juliet. This had even roved easier for him than for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius ad only to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which acillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people’s teeth. Marius as slender and readily passed through.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.2#As there was never any one in the street, and as Marius never entered the arden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.3#Beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these two ouls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period of her existence, osette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched, he would have been lost; for there are generous natures which yield themselves, nd Cosette was one of them. One of woman’s magnanimities is to yield. Love, at he height where it is absolute, is complicated with some indescribably elestial blindness of modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! Often ou give the heart, and we take the body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze pon it in the gloom with a shudder. Love has no middle course; it either ruins r it saves. All human destiny lies in this dilemma. This dilemma, ruin, or afety, is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than by love. Love is ife, if it is not death. Cradle; also coffin. The same sentiment says “yes” and no” in the human heart. Of all the things that God has made, the human heart is he one which sheds the most light, alas! and the most darkness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.4#God willed that Cosette’s love should encounter one of the loves which ave.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.5#Throughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, there were here, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, beneath that thicket hich grew thicker and more fragrant day by day, two beings composed of all hastity, all innocence, overflowing with all the felicity of heaven, nearer to he archangels than to mankind, pure, honest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone or each other amid the shadows. It seemed to Cosette that Marius had a crown, nd to Marius that Cosette had a nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed at ach other, they clasped each other’s hands, they pressed close to each other; ut there was a distance which they did not pass. Not that they respected it; hey did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier, Cosette’s nnocence; and Cosette of a support, Marius’ loyalty. The first kiss had also een the last. Marius, since that time, had not gone further than to touch osette’s hand, or her kerchief, or a lock of her hair, with his lips. For him, osette was a perfume and not a woman. He inhaled her. She refused nothing, and e asked nothing. Cosette was happy, and Marius was satisfied. They lived in his ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by nother soul. It was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the deal. Two swans meeting on the Jungfrau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.6#At that hour of love, an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute, eneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure and seraphic Marius, would ather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised Cosette’s robe to the eight of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight, Cosette stooped to pick up omething on the ground, her bodice fell apart and permitted a glimpse of the eginning of her throat. Marius turned away his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.7#What took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored each ther.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.8#At night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a sacred pot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense; and they opened heir souls and scattered them over the flowers. The wanton and vigorous egetation quivered, full of strength and intoxication, around these two nnocents, and they uttered words of love which set the trees to trembling.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.9#What words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths sufficed to rouble and to touch all nature round about. Magic power which we should find it ifficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are ade to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the eaves. Take from those murmurs of two lovers that melody which proceeds from he soul and which accompanies them like a lyre, and what remains is nothing ore than a shade; you say: “What! is that all!” eh! yes, childish prattle, epetitions, laughter at nothing, nonsense, everything that is deepest and most ublime in the world! The only things which are worth the trouble of saying and earing!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.10#The man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered these bsurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a malicious fellow. osette said to Marius:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.11#“Dost thou know?—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.12#[In all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without either f them being able to say how it had come about, they had begun to call each ther _thou_.]
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.13#“Dost thou know? My name is Euphrasie.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.14#“Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.15#“Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I was a little hing. But my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou like that name—Euphrasie?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.16#“Yes. But Cosette is not ugly.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.17#“Do you like it better than Euphrasie?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.18#“Why, yes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.19#“Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. Call me osette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.20#And the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a rove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at him and xclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.21#“Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, you are ot at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, but I bid you defiance ith this word: I love you!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.22#And Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung by a tar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.23#Or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed, and she said to im:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.24#“Don’t cough, sir; I will not have people cough on my domain without my ermission. It’s very naughty to cough and to disturb me. I want you to be well, ecause, in the first place, if you were not well, I should be very unhappy. hat should I do then?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.25#And this was simply divine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.26#Once Marius said to Cosette:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.27#“Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was Ursule.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.28#This made both of them laugh the whole evening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.29#In the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.30#“Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breaking up a eteran!” But he stopped short, and went no further. He would have been obliged o speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was impossible. This bordered on a trange theme, the flesh, before which that immense and innocent love recoiled ith a sort of sacred fright.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.31#Marius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without anything lse; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the old and ccommodating bar of the chief-justice’s gate, to sit elbow to elbow on that ench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the on-coming night, to it a fold of the knee of his trousers into the ample fall of Cosette’s gown, to aress her thumb-nail, to call her _thou_, to smell of the same flower, one fter the other, forever, indefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above heir heads. Every time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams f men than of the clouds of heaven.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.32#This chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means. To ay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of bestowing aresses, and he is half audacious who tries it. A compliment is something like kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point, hile it hides itself. The heart draws back before voluptuousness only to love he more. Marius’ blandishments, all saturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of zure hue. The birds when they fly up yonder, in the direction of the angels, ust hear such words. There were mingled with them, nevertheless, life, umanity, all the positiveness of which Marius was capable. It was what is said n the bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyrical effusion, trophe and sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles of cooing, all the efinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and exhaling a celestial perfume, n ineffable twitter of heart to heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.33#“Oh!” murmured Marius, “how beautiful you are! I dare not look at you. It s all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I know not what is he matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of your shoe peeps from eneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought ven but a little! You talk astonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times hat you are a dream. Speak, I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is nd how charming! I am really beside myself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I tudy your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.34#And Cosette answered:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.35#“I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since this orning.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.36#Questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, which lways turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figures always urn on their peg.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.37#Cosette’s whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency, hiteness, candor, radiance. It might have been said of Cosette that she was lear. She produced on those who saw her the sensation of April and dawn. There as dew in her eyes. Cosette was a condensation of the auroral light in the form f a woman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.38#It was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her. ut the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent, talked ith exquisite penetration and uttered, at times, all sorts of true and delicate ayings. Her prattle was conversation. She never made a mistake about anything, nd she saw things justly. The woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct f the heart, which is infallible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.39#No one understands so well as a woman, how to say things that are, at nce, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole of woman; in hem lies the whole of heaven.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.40#In this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. A rushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthorn broken, roused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled with melancholy, seemed o ask nothing better than to weep. The most sovereign symptom of love is a enderness that is, at times, almost unbearable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.41#And, in addition to this,—all these contradictions are the lightning play f love,—they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and with a delicious reedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the air of two oys.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.42#Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is always resent and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal and sublime bject; and however great may be the innocence of souls, one feels in the most odest private interview, the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a ouple of lovers from a pair of friends.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.43#They idolized each other.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.44#The permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they smile, hey laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips, they nterlace their fingers, they call each other _thou_, and that does not prevent ternity.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.1.45#Two lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, in the nvisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate each other in the arkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, they murmur, they hisper, and in the meantime, immense librations of the planets fill the nfinite universe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.head#CHAPTER II—THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.1#They existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not notice he cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. They had onfided in each other as far as possible, but this had not extended much urther than their names. Marius had told Cosette that he was an orphan, that is name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a lawyer, that he lived by writing hings for publishers, that his father had been a colonel, that the latter had een a hero, and that he, Marius, was on bad terms with his grandfather who was ich. He had also hinted at being a baron, but this had produced no effect on osette. She did not know the meaning of the word. Marius was Marius. On her ide, she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus onvent, that her mother, like his own, was dead, that her father’s name was M. auchelevent, that he was very good, that he gave a great deal to the poor, but hat he was poor himself, and that he denied himself everything though he denied er nothing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.2#Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since he had een in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recent past, had ecome so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette told him satisfied him ompletely. It did not even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal dventure in the hovel, about Thénardier, about the burn, and about the strange ttitude and singular flight of her father. Marius had momentarily forgotten all his; in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning, what he ad done, where he had breakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in is ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the ours when he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite natural that e should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial leasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.3#Alas! Who is there who has not felt all these things? Why does there come n hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on fterwards?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.4#Loving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent forgetfulness f all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will. There is no more bsolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical igure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosette and Marius nothing existed except arius and Cosette. The universe around them had fallen into a hole. They lived n a golden minute. There was nothing before them, nothing behind. It hardly ccurred to Marius that Cosette had a father. His brain was dazzled and bliterated. Of what did these lovers talk then? We have seen, of the flowers, nd the swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all sorts of mportant things. They had told each other everything except everything. The verything of lovers is nothing. But the father, the realities, that lair, the uffians, that adventure, to what purpose? And was he very sure that this ightmare had actually existed? They were two, and they adored each other, and eyond that there was nothing. Nothing else existed. It is probable that this anishing of hell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we eheld demons? Are there any? Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer now. A rosy cloud hangs over it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.5#So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all that mprobability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at the zenith, etween man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, in the clouds; hardly lesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot; already too sublime to walk he earth, still too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue, uspended like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond the ounds of destiny; ignorant of that rut; yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; amazed, apturous, floating, soaring; at times so light that they could take their light out into the infinite; almost prepared to soar away to all eternity. They lept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of the real verwhelmed by the ideal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.6#Sometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes in her presence. he best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.2.7#Marius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them. hey considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange claim on man’s art to wish that love should lead to something.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.head#CHAPTER III—THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.1#Jean Valjean suspected nothing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.2#Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that sufficed or Jean Valjean’s happiness. The thoughts which Cosette cherished, her tender reoccupations, Marius’ image which filled her heart, took away nothing from the ncomparable purity of her beautiful, chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the ge when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ase. And then, when two lovers have come to an understanding, things always go ell; the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect lindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in the ase of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of Jean Valjean’s roposals. Did she want to take a walk? “Yes, dear little father.” Did she want o stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass the evening with Cosette? She as delighted. As he always went to bed at ten o’clock, Marius did not come to he garden on such occasions until after that hour, when, from the street, he eard Cosette open the long glass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever et Marius in the daytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that arius was in existence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette: Why, you have whitewash on your back!” On the previous evening, Marius, in a ransport, had pushed Cosette against the wall.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.3#Old Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her sleep, and was s ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.4#Marius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hid hemselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neither be seen or heard from the street, and there they sat, frequently contenting themselves, y way of conversation, with pressing each other’s hands twenty times a minute s they gazed at the branches of the trees. At such times, a thunderbolt might ave fallen thirty paces from them, and they would not have noticed it, so eeply was the reverie of the one absorbed and sunk in the reverie of the ther.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.5#Limpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort of love is a ecollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.6#The whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Every time hat Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the gate in such manner that no displacement was visible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.7#He usually went away about midnight, and returned to Courfeyrac’s lodgings. ourfeyrac said to Bahorel:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.8#“Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o’clock in the orning.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.9#Bahorel replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.10#“What do you expect? There’s always a petard in a seminary fellow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.11#At times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said to arius:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.12#“You are getting irregular in your habits, young man.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.13#Courfeyrac, being a practical man, did not take in good part this eflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in the habit of oncealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then he called upon arius to come back to reality.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.14#One morning, he threw him this admonition:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.15#“My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located in the oon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital, soap-bubble. ome, be a good boy, what’s her name?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.16#But nothing could induce Marius “to talk.” They might have torn out his ails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name, osette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and as silent as the omb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that his taciturnity was of he beaming order.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.17#During this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know these mmense delights. To dispute and to say _you_ for _thou_, simply that they might ay _thou_ the better afterwards. To talk at great length with very minute etails, of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the world; nother proof that in that ravishing opera called love, the libretto counts for lmost nothing;
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.18#For Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery;

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.20#To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue de abylone;

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.24#In the meantime, divers complications were approaching.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.25#One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the oulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As he was on he point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some one quite close o him say:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.26#“Good evening, Monsieur Marius.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.27#He raised his head and recognized Éponine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.28#This produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of that girl single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue Plumet, he had ot seen her again, and she had gone completely out of his mind. He had no easons for anything but gratitude towards her, he owed her his happiness, and et, it was embarrassing to him to meet her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.29#It is an error to think that passion, when it is pure and happy, leads man o a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, to a state of blivion. In this situation, man forgets to be bad, but he also forgets to be ood. Gratitude, duty, matters essential and important to be remembered, vanish. t any other time, Marius would have behaved quite differently to Éponine. bsorbed in Cosette, he had not even clearly put it to himself that this Éponine as named Éponine Thénardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in his ather’s will, that name, for which, but a few months before, he would have so rdently sacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father himself was ading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor of his love.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.30#He replied with some embarrassment:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.31#“Ah! so it’s you, Éponine?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.32#“Why do you call me _you?_ Have I done anything to you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.33#“No,” he answered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.34#Certainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt that he ould not do otherwise, now that he used _thou_ to Cosette, than say _you_ to ponine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.35#As he remained silent, she exclaimed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.36#“Say—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.37#Then she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature formerly o heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not. Then she esumed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.38#“Well?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.39#Then she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.3.40#“Good evening, Mr. Marius,” said she suddenly and abruptly; and away she ent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.head#CHAPTER IV—A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.1#The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessary to ndicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon f Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, at nightfall, was ursuing the same road as on the preceding evening, with the same thoughts of elight in his heart, when he caught sight of Éponine approaching, through the rees of the boulevard. Two days in succession—this was too much. He turned astily aside, quitted the boulevard, changed his course and went to the Rue lumet through the Rue Monsieur.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.2#This caused Éponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which she had ot yet done. Up to that time, she had contented herself with watching him on is passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him. It was nly on the evening before that she had attempted to address him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.3#So Éponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw him isplace the bar and slip into the garden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.4#She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, and eadily recognized the one which Marius had moved.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.5#She murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.6#“None of that, Lisette!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.7#She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside the ar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point where the ailing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, in which ponine was entirely concealed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.8#She remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and without reathing, a prey to her thoughts.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.9#Towards ten o’clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons who assed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was making haste to scape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirted the garden railings nd reached the angle which it made with the wall, heard a dull and threatening oice saying:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.10#“I’m no longer surprised that he comes here every evening.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.11#The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer into he black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.12#This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later, ix men, who were marching separately and at some distance from each other, long the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol, entered the Rue lumet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.13#The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for the thers; a second later, all six were reunited.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.14#These men began to talk in a low voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.15#“This is the place,” said one of them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.16#“Is there a _cab_ [dog] in the garden?” asked another.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.17#“I don’t know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we’ll make him at.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.18#“Have you some putty to break the pane with?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.19#“Yes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.20#“The railing is old,” interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of a entriloquist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.21#“So much the better,” said the second who had spoken. “It won’t screech nder the saw, and it won’t be hard to cut.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.22#The sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect the gate, s Éponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in succession, and haking them cautiously.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.23#Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the point f grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness, fell upon his rm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his reast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not loudly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.24#“There’s a dog.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.25#At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.26#The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. He ristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious easts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.27#He recoiled and stammered:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.28#“What jade is this?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.29#“Your daughter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.30#It was, in fact, Éponine, who had addressed Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.31#At the apparition of Éponine, the other five, that is to say, Claquesous, uelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near, without recipitation, without uttering a word, with the sinister slowness peculiar to hese men of the night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.32#Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands. Guelemer eld one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call _fanchons_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.33#“Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are you razy?” exclaimed Thénardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low; what have you come here to hinder our work for?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.34#Éponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.35#“I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn’t a person allowed to it on the stones nowadays? It’s you who ought not to be here. What have you ome here for, since it’s a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There’s nothing to be one here. But embrace me, my good little father! It’s a long time since I’ve een you! So you’re out?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.36#Thénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine’s arms, and rumbled:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.37#“That’s good. You’ve embraced me. Yes, I’m out. I’m not in. Now, get away ith you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.38#But Éponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.39#“But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever to et out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother? Tell me about amma.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.40#Thénardier replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.41#“She’s well. I don’t know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.42#“I won’t go, so there now,” pouted Éponine like a spoiled child; “you send e off, and it’s four months since I saw you, and I’ve hardly had time to kiss ou.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.43#And she caught her father round the neck again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.44#“Come, now, this is stupid!” said Babet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.45#“Make haste!” said Guelemer, “the cops may pass.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.46#The ventriloquist’s voice repeated his distich:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.47#“Nous n’ sommes pas le jour de l’an, “This isn’t New Year’s day A bécoter apa, maman.” To peck at pa and ma.” 
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.48#Éponine turned to the five ruffians.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.49#“Why, it’s Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day, Monsieur laquesous. Don’t you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? How goes it, ontparnasse?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.50#“Yes, they know you!” ejaculated Thénardier. “But good day, good evening, heer off! leave us alone!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.51#“It’s the hour for foxes, not for chickens,” said Montparnasse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.52#“You see the job we have on hand here,” added Babet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.53#Éponine caught Montparnasse’s hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.54#“Take care,” said he, “you’ll cut yourself, I’ve a knife open.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.55#“My little Montparnasse,” responded Éponine very gently, “you must have onfidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. Monsieur Babet, onsieur Guelemer, I’m the person who was charged to investigate this atter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.56#It is remarkable that Éponine did not talk slang. That frightful tongue ad become impossible to her since she had known Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.57#She pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton, uelemer’s huge, coarse fingers, and continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.58#“You know well that I’m no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I have endered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries; you will xpose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you that there is nothing n this house.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.59#“There are lone women,” said Guelemer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.60#“No, the persons have moved away.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.61#“The candles haven’t, anyway!” ejaculated Babet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.62#And he pointed out to Éponine, across the tops of the trees, a light which as wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was Toussaint, who ad stayed up to spread out some linen to dry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.63#Éponine made a final effort.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.64#“Well,” said she, “they’re very poor folks, and it’s a hovel where there sn’t a sou.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.65#“Go to the devil!” cried Thénardier. “When we’ve turned the house upside own and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we’ll tell you what here is inside, and whether it’s francs or sous or half-farthings.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.66#And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.67#“My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse,” said Éponine, “I entreat you, you are good fellow, don’t enter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.68#“Take care, you’ll cut yourself,” replied Montparnasse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.69#Thénardier resumed in his decided tone:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.70#“Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.71#Éponine released Montparnasse’s hand, which she had grasped again, and aid:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.72#“So you mean to enter this house?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.73#“Rather!” grinned the ventriloquist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.74#Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were rmed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons, and said n a firm, low voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.75#“Well, I don’t mean that you shall.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.76#They halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin. he went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.77#“Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I’m talking. In the irst place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this gate, I’ll cream, I’ll beat on the door, I’ll rouse everybody, I’ll have the whole six of ou seized, I’ll call the police.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.78#“She’d do it, too,” said Thénardier in a low tone to Brujon and the entriloquist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.79#She shook her head and added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.80#“Beginning with my father!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.81#Thénardier stepped nearer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.82#“Not so close, my good man!” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.83#He retreated, growling between his teeth:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.84#“Why, what’s the matter with her?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.85#And he added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.86#“Bitch!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.87#She began to laugh in a terrible way:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.4.93#Then she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon the uffians in turn:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.5.1#After the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its tranquil, octurnal aspect. That which had just taken place in this street would not have stonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses, the heaths, the branches udely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in a sombre manner; the savage swarming here catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible; that which is elow man distinguishes, through the mists, that which is beyond man; and the hings of which we living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the ight. Nature, bristling and wild, takes alarm at certain approaches in which he fancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom know each ther, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and claws fear what they annot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, hunger in search f prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source and aim the elly, glare and smell out uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying eneath a shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem to them o live with a dead and terrible life.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.1#While this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the ate, and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was by osette’s side.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.2#Never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming, the trees ore trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; never had the birds allen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; never had all the harmonies f universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the inward music of love; ever had Marius been more captivated, more happy, more ecstatic.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.3#But he had found Cosette sad; Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes were ed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.4#This was the first cloud in that wonderful dream.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.5#Marius’ first word had been: “What is the matter?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.6#And she had replied: “This.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.7#Then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, and while he remblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.8#“My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because he has usiness, and we may go away from here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.9#Marius shivered from head to foot.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.10#When one is at the end of one’s life, to die means to go away; when one is t the beginning of it, to go away means to die.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.11#For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees, aken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already explained, in the case f first love, the soul is taken long before the body; later on, one takes the ody long before the soul; sometimes one does not take the soul at all; the aublas and the Prudhommes add: “Because there is none”; but the sarcasm is, ortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius possessed Cosette, as spirits possess, but e enveloped her with all his soul, and seized her jealously with incredible onviction. He possessed her smile, her breath, her perfume, the profound adiance of her blue eyes, the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand, he charming mark which she had on her neck, all her thoughts. Therefore, he ossessed all Cosette’s dreams.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.12#He incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath, he short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to himself that there as not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him, Marius. He gazed pon and adored the things that she wore, her knot of ribbon, her gloves, her leeves, her shoes, her cuffs, as sacred objects of which he was the master. He reamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her air, and he even said to himself, in confused and suppressed stammerings of oluptuousness which did not make their way to the light, that there was not a ibbon of her gown, not a mesh in her stockings, not a fold in her bodice, which as not his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property, his own hing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed as though they had so ntermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible to tell them apart ad they wished to take them back again.—“This is mine.” “No, it is mine.” “I ssure you that you are mistaken. This is my property.” “What you are taking as our own is myself.”—Marius was something that made a part of Cosette, and osette was something which made a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette within im. To have Cosette, to possess Cosette, this, to him, was not to be istinguished from breathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of this ntoxication, of this virgin possession, unprecedented and absolute, of this overeignty, that these words: “We are going away,” fell suddenly, at a blow, nd that the harsh voice of reality cried to him: “Cosette is not yours!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.13#Marius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said, utside of life; those words, _going away!_ caused him to re-enter it arshly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.14#He found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was very old. She said to him in her turn: “What is the matter?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.15#He replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.16#“I did not understand what you said.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.17#She began again:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.18#“This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to old myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk, hat he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away, that it is ecessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him, and that all is o be ready in a week from now, and that we might go to England.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.19#“But this is outrageous!” exclaimed Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.20#It is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of power, no violence, not ne of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris, of Tiberius, r of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in atrocity, in the opinion of arius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to England because he had usiness there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.21#He demanded in a weak voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.22#“And when do you start?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.23#“He did not say when.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.24#“And when shall you return?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.25#“He did not say when.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.26#Marius rose and said coldly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.27#“Cosette, shall you go?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.28#Cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish, and eplied in a sort of bewilderment:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.29#“Where?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.30#“To England. Shall you go?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.31#“Why do you say _you_ to me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.32#“I ask you whether you will go?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.33#“What do you expect me to do?” she said, clasping her hands.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.34#“So, you will go?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.35#“If my father goes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.36#“So, you will go?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.37#Cosette took Marius’ hand, and pressed it without replying.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.38#“Very well,” said Marius, “then I will go elsewhere.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.39#Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words. She turned o pale that her face shone white through the gloom. She stammered:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.40#“What do you mean?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.41#Marius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, and answered: Nothing.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.42#When his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette smiling at him. The smile of a oman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance, even at night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.43#“How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.44#“What is it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.45#“If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come and join me herever I am.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.46#Marius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into reality. e cried to Cosette:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.47#“Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, and I ave none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I don’t know how much, ore than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom you are not cquainted! I have an old hat which is not worth three francs, I have a coat hich lacks buttons in front, my shirt is all ragged, my elbows are torn, my oots let in the water; for the last six weeks I have not thought about it, and have not told you about it. You only see me at night, and you give me your ove; if you were to see me in the daytime, you would give me a sou! Go to ngland! Eh! I haven’t enough to pay for a passport!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.48#He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, his brow ressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin, nor he fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there he stood motionless, on he point of falling, like the statue of despair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.49#He remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in such bysses. At last he turned round. He heard behind him a faint stifled noise, hich was sweet yet sad.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.50#It was Cosette sobbing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.51#She had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as he editated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.52#He came to her, fell at her knees, and slowly prostrating himself, he took he tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, and kissed it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.53#She let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a woman ccepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.54#“Do not weep,” he said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.55#She murmured:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.56#“Not when I may be going away, and you cannot come!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.57#He went on:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.58#“Do you love me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.59#She replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never more harming than amid tears:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.60#“I adore you!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.61#He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.62#“Do not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.63#“Do you love me?” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.64#He took her hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.65#“Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, because my word f honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well, I give you my ost sacred word of honor, that if you go away I shall die.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.66#In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so olemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill which is roduced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock made her cease eeping.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.67#“Now, listen,” said he, “do not expect me to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.68#“Why?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.69#“Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.70#“Oh! Why?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.71#“You will see.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.72#“A day without seeing you! But that is impossible!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.73#“Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives, perhaps.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.74#And Marius added in a low tone and in an aside:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.75#“He is a man who never changes his habits, and he has never received any ne except in the evening.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.76#“Of what man are you speaking?” asked Cosette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.77#“I? I said nothing.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.78#“What do you hope, then?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.79#“Wait until the day after to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.80#“You wish it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.81#“Yes, Cosette.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.82#She took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in order to e on a level with him, and tried to read his hope in his eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.83#Marius resumed:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.84#“Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: something might appen, one never knows; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac, Rue de la errerie, No. 16.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.85#He searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade he rote on the plaster of the wall:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.86#_“16 Rue de la Verrerie.”_
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.87#In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.88#“Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. Oh! tell e, so that I may pass a pleasant night.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.89#“This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean to part us. ait; expect me the day after to-morrow.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.90#“What shall I do until then?” said Cosette. “You are outside, you go, and ome! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad I shall be! hat is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.91#“I am going to try something.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.92#“Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you may be uccessful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish it.

But day after to-morrow you will come early. I shall expect you at usk, at nine o’clock precisely, I warn you. Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the ays are so long!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.93#“And I also.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.94#And without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled by hose electric currents which place lovers in continual communication, both eing intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow, they fell into each other’s rms, without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes, verflowing with rapture and full of tears, gazed upon the stars.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.95#When Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the moment when ponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.6.96#While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, an idea ad crossed his mind; an idea, alas! that he himself judged to be senseless and mpossible. He had come to a desperate decision.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.head#CHAPTER VII—THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH THER
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.1#At that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first birthday. e still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, o. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as the reader will remember, one f those antique old men who await death perfectly erect, whom age bears down ithout bending, and whom even sorrow cannot curve.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.2#Still, his daughter had been saying for some time: “My father is sinking.” e no longer boxed the maids’ ears; he no longer thumped the landing-place so igorously with his cane when Basque was slow in opening the door. The evolution of July had exasperated him for the space of barely six months. He ad viewed, almost tranquilly, that coupling of words, in the _Moniteur:_ M. umblot-Conté, peer of France. The fact is, that the old man was deeply ejected. He did not bend, he did not yield; this was no more a characteristic f his physical than of his moral nature, but he felt himself giving way nternally. For four years he had been waiting for Marius, with his foot firmly lanted, that is the exact word, in the conviction that that good-for-nothing oung scamp would ring at his door some day or other; now he had reached the oint, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said to himself, that if Marius made im wait much longer—It was not death that was insupportable to him; it was the dea that perhaps he should never see Marius again. The idea of never seeing arius again had never entered his brain until that day; now the thought began o recur to him, and it chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine nd natural sentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather’s love for he ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It is during December ights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks oftenest of the on.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.3#M. Gillenormand was, or thought himself, above all things, incapable of aking a single step, he—the grandfather, towards his grandson; “I would die ather,” he said to himself. He did not consider himself as the least to blame; ut he thought of Marius only with profound tenderness, and the mute despair of n elderly, kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.4#He began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.5#M. Gillenormand, without however acknowledging it to himself, for it would ave rendered him furious and ashamed, had never loved a mistress as he loved arius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.6#He had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so that it hould be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, an old portrait of is other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy, a portrait which had been aken when she was eighteen. He gazed incessantly at that portrait. One day, he appened to say, as he gazed upon it:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.7#“I think the likeness is strong.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.8#“To my sister?” inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. “Yes, certainly.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.9#The old man added:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.10#“And to him also.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.11#Once as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almost losed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured to say to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.12#“Father, are you as angry with him as ever?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.13#She paused, not daring to proceed further.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.14#“With whom?” he demanded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.15#“With that poor Marius.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.16#He raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on the able, and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.17#“Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretched scoundrel, vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, and wicked man!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.18#And he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stood n his eye.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.19#Three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to say to is daughter point-blank:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.20#“I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him to e.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.21#Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced this acute iagnosis: “My father never cared very much for my sister after her folly. It is lear that he detests Marius.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.22#“After her folly” meant: “after she had married the colonel.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.23#However, as the reader has been able to conjecture, Mademoiselle illenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, the officer f lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Théodule, had not been a success. M. illenormand had not accepted the _quid pro quo_. A vacancy in the heart does ot accommodate itself to a stop-gap. Théodule, on his side, though he scented he inheritance, was disgusted at the task of pleasing. The goodman bored the ancer; and the lancer shocked the goodman. Lieutenant Théodule was gay, no oubt, but a chatter-box, frivolous, but vulgar; a high liver, but a frequenter f bad company; he had mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to say bout them, it is true also; but he talked badly. All his good qualities had a efect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love ffairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue de Babylone. And hen, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform, with the tricolored ockade. This rendered him downright intolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand ad said to his daughter: “I’ve had enough of that Théodule. I haven’t much aste for warriors in time of peace. Receive him if you choose. I don’t know but prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of blades in attle is less dismal, after all, than the clank of the scabbard on the avement. And then, throwing out your chest like a bully and lacing yourself ike a girl, with stays under your cuirass, is doubly ridiculous. When one is a eritable man, one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected airs. He s neither a blusterer nor a finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Théodule for ourself.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.24#It was in vain that his daughter said to him: “But he is your grandnephew, evertheless,”—it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who was a grandfather to the ery finger-tips, was not in the least a grand-uncle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.25#In fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Théodule ad only served to make him regret Marius all the more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.26#One evening,—it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent Father illenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,—he had dismissed his daughter, ho was sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone in his chamber, amid its astoral scenes, with his feet propped on the andirons, half enveloped in his uge screen of coromandel lacquer, with its nine leaves, with his elbow resting n a table where burned two candles under a green shade, engulfed in his apestry armchair, and in his hand a book which he was not reading. He was ressed, according to his wont, like an _incroyable_, and resembled an antique ortrait by Garat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had ot his daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop’s wadded loak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a dressing gown, xcept when he rose and retired. “It gives one a look of age,” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.27#Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and, as sual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured always ended by oiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point where a man tries o make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart. He was explaining o himself that there was no longer any reason why Marius should return, that if e intended to return, he should have done it long ago, that he must renounce he idea. He was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over, nd that he should die without having beheld “that gentleman” again. But his hole nature revolted; his aged paternity would not consent to this. “Well!” aid he,—this was his doleful refrain,—“he will not return!” His bald head had allen upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the shes on his hearth.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.30#The old man sat up erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises under the nfluence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to his heart. He tammered:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.31#“M. Marius what?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.32#“I don’t know,” replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenance by is master’s air; “I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said to me: There’s a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.’”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.33#Father Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.34#“Show him in.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.35#And he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyes ixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It was Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.36#Marius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.37#His almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by he shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely sad ace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.38#It was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with amazement nd joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the presence f an apparition. He was on the point of swooning; he saw Marius through a azzling light. It certainly was he, it certainly was Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.39#At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so to peak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, distinguished, ell-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming air. He felt a esire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward; his heart melted ith rapture, affectionate words swelled and overflowed his breast; at length ll his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips, and, by a contrast hich constituted the very foundation of his nature, what came forth was arshness. He said abruptly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.40#“What have you come here for?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.41#Marius replied with embarrassment:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.42#“Monsieur—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.43#M. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself into his rms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He was conscious that he as brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodman unendurable and rritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn within, and only to be able to e hard outside. Bitterness returned. He interrupted Marius in a peevish one:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.44#“Then why did you come?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.45#That “then” signified: _If you do not come to embrace me_. Marius looked t his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.46#“Monsieur—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.47#“Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.48#He thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that “the child” ould yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father that was required f him; he dropped his eyes and replied:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.49#“No, sir.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.50#“Then,” exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was poignant nd full of wrath, “what do you want of me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.51#Marius clasped his hands, advanced a step, and said in a feeble and rembling voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.52#“Sir, have pity on me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.53#These words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they would ave rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather rose; he upported himself with both hands on his cane; his lips were white, his brow avered, but his lofty form towered above Marius as he bowed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.54#“Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man of inety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to the play, to alls, to the café, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, you please the women, ou are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on my brands in the heart of ummer; you are rich with the only riches that are really such, I possess all he poverty of age; infirmity, isolation! You have your thirty-two teeth, a good igestion, bright eyes, strength, appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black air; I have no longer even white hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my egs, I am losing my memory; there are three names of streets that I confound ncessantly, the Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue Saint-Claude, that s what I have come to; you have before you the whole future, full of sunshine, nd I am beginning to lose my sight, so far am I advancing into the night; you re in love, that is a matter of course, I am beloved by no one in all the orld; and you ask pity of me! Parbleu! Molière forgot that. If that is the way ou jest at the courthouse, Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. ou are droll.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.55#And the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.56#“Come, now, what do you want of me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.57#“Sir,” said Marius, “I know that my presence is displeasing to you, but I ave come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go away mmediately.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.58#“You are a fool!” said the old man. “Who said that you were to go way?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.59#This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of is heart:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.60#“Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.61#M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, that is harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was driving him way; he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief; and as his grief as straightway converted into wrath, it increased his harshness. He would have iked to have Marius understand, and Marius did not understand, which made the oodman furious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.62#He began again:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.63#“What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go no one nows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it is easily uessed, to lead a bachelor life; it’s more convenient, to play the dandy, to ome in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given me no signs of life, you ave contracted debts without even telling me to pay them, you have become a masher of windows and a blusterer, and, at the end of four years, you come to e, and that is all you have to say to me!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.64#This violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive nly of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms; a esture which with him was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophized Marius itterly:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.65#“Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, you ay? Well, what? What is it? Speak!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.66#“Sir,” said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling ver a precipice, “I have come to ask your permission to marry.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.67#M. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.68#“Call my daughter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.69#A second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle Gillenormand id not enter, but showed herself; Marius was standing, mute, with pendant arms nd the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was pacing back and forth in the oom. He turned to his daughter and said to her:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.70#“Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes to arry. That’s all. Go away.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.71#The curt, hoarse sound of the old man’s voice announced a strange degree f excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air, hardly appeared o recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a syllable to escape her, and isappeared at her father’s breath more swiftly than a straw before the urricane.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.72#In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his back gainst the chimney-piece once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.73#“You marry! At one and twenty! You have arranged that! You have only a ermission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you have had a revolution ince I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got the upper hand. You must ave been delighted. Are you not a Republican since you are a Baron? You can ake that agree. The Republic makes a good sauce for the barony. Are you one of hose decorated by July? Have you taken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, n the Rue Saint-Antoine, opposite the Rue des Nonamdières, there is a annon-ball incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this nscription: ‘July 28th, 1830.’ Go take a look at that. It produces a good ffect. Ah! those friends of yours do pretty things. By the way, aren’t they recting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry? So you ant to marry? Whom? Can one inquire without indiscretion?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.74#He paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.75#“Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you earn at our trade of lawyer?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.76#“Nothing,” said Marius, with a sort of firmness and resolution that was lmost fierce.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.77#“Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livres hat I allow you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.78#Marius did not reply. M. Gillenormand continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.79#“Then I understand the girl is rich?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.80#“As rich as I am.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.81#“What! No dowry?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.82#“No.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.92#“Sir!” exclaimed Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.93#M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to imself:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.94#“That’s right, one and twenty years of age, no profession, twelve hundred ivres a year, Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go and purchase a couple of ous’ worth of parsley from the fruiterer.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.95#“Sir,” repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which was anishing, “I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, with clasped ands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, permit me to marry her!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.96#The old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter, coughing nd laughing at the same time.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.97#“Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: ‘Pardine! I’ll go hunt up that old lockhead, that absurd numskull! What a shame that I’m not twenty-five! How I’d reat him to a nice respectful summons! How nicely I’d get along without him! t’s nothing to me, I’d say to him: “You’re only too happy to see me, you old diot, I want to marry, I desire to wed Mamselle No-matter-whom, daughter of onsieur No-matter-what, I have no shoes, she has no chemise, that just suits; I ant to throw my career, my future, my youth, my life to the dogs; I wish to ake a plunge into wretchedness with a woman around my neck, that’s an idea, and ou must consent to it!” and the old fossil will consent.’ Go, my lad, do as you ike, attach your paving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, your Coupelevent—Never, ir, never!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.100#At the tone in which that “never” was uttered, Marius lost all hope. He raversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering and more like dying man than like one merely taking his departure. M. Gillenormand followed im with his eyes, and at the moment when the door opened, and Marius was on the oint of going out, he advanced four paces, with the senile vivacity of mpetuous and spoiled old gentlemen, seized Marius by the collar, brought him ack energetically into the room, flung him into an armchair and said to im:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.101#“Tell me all about it!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.102#“It was that single word “father” which had effected this revolution.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.103#Marius stared at him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormand’s mobile face was o longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature. The randsire had given way before the grandfather.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.104#“Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs, jabber, tell me verything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.107#“Yes, that’s right, call me father, and you’ll see!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.108#There was now something so kind, so gentle, so openhearted, and so aternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition from iscouragement to hope, was stunned and intoxicated by it, as it were. He was eated near the table, the light from the candles brought out the dilapidation f his costume, which Father Gillenormand regarded with amazement.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.109#“Well, father—” said Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.110#“Ah, by the way,” interrupted M. Gillenormand, “you really have not a enny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.111#He rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the table: Here are a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.112#“Father,” pursued Marius, “my good father, if you only knew! I love her. ou cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg, she came here; in the beginning, I did not pay much heed to her, and then, I don’t know ow it came about, I fell in love with her. Oh! how unhappy that made me! Now, t last, I see her every day, at her own home, her father does not know it, just ancy, they are going away, it is in the garden that we meet, in the evening, er father means to take her to England, then I said to myself: ‘I’ll go and see y grandfather and tell him all about the affair. I should go mad first, I hould die, I should fall ill, I should throw myself into the water. I bsolutely must marry her, since I should go mad otherwise.’ This is the whole ruth, and I do not think that I have omitted anything. She lives in a garden ith an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhood of the nvalides.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.113#Father Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance, eside Marius. As he listened to him and drank in the sound of his voice, he njoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. At the words “Rue Plumet” e interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of his snuff to fall pon his knees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.114#“The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?—Let us see!—Are there not arracks in that vicinity?—Why, yes, that’s it.

For my part, I will do myself the ustice to say, that in the line of _sans-culottes_, I have never loved any one ut women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce! There’s no objection to hat. As for the little one, she receives you without her father’s knowledge. hat’s in the established order of things. I have had adventures of that same ort myself. More than one. Do you know what is done then? One does not take the atter ferociously; one does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does ot make one’s mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One simply ehaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along, mortals; on’t marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a good-natured fellow t bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; you say to im: ‘See here, grandfather.’ And the grandfather says: ‘That’s a simple matter. outh must amuse itself, and old age must wear out. I have been young, you will e old. Come, my boy, you shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two undred pistoles. Amuse yourself, deuce take it!’ Nothing better!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.116#The old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a slap on he knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air, and aid to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.118#Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather had ust said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks, the lancer, ad passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing of all that could bear ny reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The good man was wandering in his ind. But this wandering terminated in words which Marius did understand, and hich were a mortal insult to Cosette. Those words, “make her your mistress,” ntered the heart of the strict young man like a sword.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.119#He rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to the door ith a firm, assured step. There he turned round, bowed deeply to his randfather, raised his head erect again, and said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.122#The old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though struck y lightning, without the power to speak or breathe, as though a clenched fist rasped his throat. At last he tore himself from his armchair, ran, so far as a an can run at ninety-one, to the door, opened it, and cried:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.8.7.125#He went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open with is aged and palsied hands, leaned out more than half-way, while Basque and icolette held him behind, and shouted:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.1#That same day, towards four o’clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean was itting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the hamp-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate, or simply in onsequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which gradually ntroduce themselves into the existence of every one, he now rarely went out ith Cosette. He had on his workman’s waistcoat, and trousers of gray linen; and is long-visored cap concealed his countenance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.2#He was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, for a time, larmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week or two, nxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking on the oulevard, he had caught sight of Thénardier; thanks to his disguise, Thénardier ad not recognized him; but since that day, Jean Valjean had seen him epeatedly, and he was now certain that Thénardier was prowling about in their eighborhood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.3#This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.4#Moreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented this nconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in his life, that he police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and that while seeking to erret out a man like Pépin or Morey, they might very readily discover a man ike Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.5#Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and go ver to England.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.6#He had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.7#He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning over all orts of thoughts in his mind,—Thénardier, the police, the journey, and the ifficulty of procuring a passport.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.8#He was troubled from all these points of view.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.9#Last of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his ttention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added to his state of larm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.10#On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household was tirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette’s shutters were open, he ad suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line, engraved, probably with nail:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.23#Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope; he azed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child, not so large s a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust-colored cotton velvet, who as jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the hamp-de-Mars.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.1.24#Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.head#CHAPTER II—MARIUS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.1#Marius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house with ery little hope, and quitted it with immense despair.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.2#However, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will nderstand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Théodule, had left o trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poet might, apparently, xpect some complications from this revelation made point-blank by the randfather to the grandson. But what the drama would gain thereby, truth would ose. Marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil; later n comes the age when one believes everything. Suspicions are nothing else than rinkles. Early youth has none of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides nnocuous over Candide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius ould sooner have committed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.3#He began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer. He hought of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At two o’clock in he morning he returned to Courfeyrac’s quarters and flung himself, without ndressing, on his mattress. The sun was shining brightly when he sank into that rightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and come in the brain. When e awoke, he saw Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre standing in the oom with their hats on and all ready to go out.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.4#Courfeyrac said to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.5#“Are you coming to General Lamarque’s funeral?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.6#It seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.7#He went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols which avert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of February, and hich had remained in his hands. These pistols were still loaded. It would be ifficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he took them with im.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.8#All day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; it ained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased a penny oll at a baker’s, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appears that he took a ath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are moments when a man has a urnace within his skull. Marius was passing through one of those moments. He no onger hoped for anything; this step he had taken since the preceding evening. e waited for night with feverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before is mind;—this was, that at nine o’clock he should see Cosette. This last appiness now constituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, as e roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that he heard trange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his reverie and said: “Is here fighting on hand?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.9#At nightfall, at nine o’clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette, he was n the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot everything. It was orty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; he was about to behold her once ore; every other thought was effaced, and he felt only a profound and nheard-of joy. Those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this overeign and wonderful property, that at the moment when they are passing they ill the heart completely.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.10#Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette was ot at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed the thicket, nd approached the recess near the flight of steps: “She is waiting for me here,” said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his eyes, and saw that the hutters of the house were closed. He made the tour of the garden, the garden as deserted. Then he returned to the house, and, rendered senseless by love, ntoxicated, terrified, exasperated with grief and uneasiness, like a master who eturns home at an evil hour, he tapped on the shutters. He knocked and knocked gain, at the risk of seeing the window open, and her father’s gloomy face make ts appearance, and demand: “What do you want?” This was nothing in comparison ith what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he had rapped, he lifted up his oice and called Cosette.—“Cosette!” he cried; “Cosette!” he repeated mperiously. There was no reply. All was over. No one in the garden; no one in he house.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.11#Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as black nd as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stone seat on which e had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then he seated himself on the light of steps, his heart filled with sweetness and resolution, he blessed his ove in the depths of his thought, and he said to himself that, since Cosette as gone, all that there was left for him was to die.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.12#All at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street, and hich was calling to him through the trees:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.13#“Mr. Marius!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.14#He started to his feet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.15#“Hey?” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.16#“Mr. Marius, are you there?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.17#“Yes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.18#“Mr. Marius,” went on the voice, “your friends are waiting for you at the arricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.2.19#This voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse, ough voice of Éponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside the movable ar, passed his head through the aperture, and saw some one who appeared to him o be a young man, disappearing at a run into the gloom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.head#CHAPTER III—M. MABEUF
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.1#Jean Valjean’s purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his enerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars; he had ot admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d’or. He had not divined hat what had fallen from heaven had come from Gavroche. He had taken the purse o the police commissioner of the quarter, as a lost article placed by the inder at the disposal of claimants. The purse was actually lost. It is nnecessary to say that no one claimed it, and that it did not succor M. abeuf.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.2#Moreover, M. Mabeuf had continued his downward course.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.3#His experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the Jardin des lantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before he had owed his ousekeeper’s wages; now, as we have seen, he owed three quarters of his rent. he pawnshop had sold the plates of his _Flora_ after the expiration of thirteen onths. Some coppersmith had made stewpans of them. His copper plates gone, and eing unable to complete even the incomplete copies of his _Flora_ which were in is possession, he had disposed of the text, at a miserable price, as waste aper, to a second-hand bookseller. Nothing now remained to him of his life’s ork. He set to work to eat up the money for these copies. When he saw that this retched resource was becoming exhausted, he gave up his garden and allowed it o run to waste. Before this, a long time before, he had given up his two eggs nd the morsel of beef which he ate from time to time. He dined on bread and otatoes. He had sold the last of his furniture, then all duplicates of his edding, his clothing and his blankets, then his herbariums and prints; but he till retained his most precious books, many of which were of the greatest arity, among others, _Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible_, edition of 1560; La Concordance des Bibles_, by Pierre de Besse; _Les Marguerites de la arguerite_, of Jean de La Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre; the ook _de la Charge et Dignité de l’Ambassadeur_, by the Sieur de Villiers otman; a _Florilegium Rabbinicum_ of 1644; a _Tibullus_ of 1567, with this agnificent inscription: _Venetiis, in ædibus Manutianis_; and lastly, a iogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained the famous variant f the manuscript 411, thirteenth century, of the Vatican, and those of the two anuscripts of Venice, 393 and 394, consulted with such fruitful results by enri Estienne, and all the passages in Doric dialect which are only found in he celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the Naples ibrary. M. Mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber, and went to bed at undown, in order not to consume any candles. It seemed as though he had no onger any neighbors: people avoided him when he went out; he perceived the act. The wretchedness of a child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a oung man interests a young girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no ne. It is, of all distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not ntirely lost his childlike serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they ested on his books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius, which as a unique copy. His bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture hich he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.4#One day, Mother Plutarque said to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.5#“I have no money to buy any dinner.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.6#What she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.7#“On credit?” suggested M. Mabeuf.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.8#“You know well that people refuse me.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.9#M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all his books, one after nother, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them efore making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it in under his arm and ent out. He returned two hours later, without anything under his arm, laid hirty sous on the table, and said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.10#“You will get something for dinner.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.11#From that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which was ever more lifted, descend over the old man’s candid face.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.12#On the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, it had o be done again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.13#M. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As the econd-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they purchased of him or twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs, sometimes at those ery shops. Volume by volume, the whole library went the same road. He said at imes: “But I am eighty;” as though he cherished some secret hope that he should rrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books. His elancholy increased. Once, however, he had a pleasure. He had gone out with a obert Estienne, which he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai alaquais, and he returned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous in he Rue des Grès.—“I owe five sous,” he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That ay he had no dinner.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.14#He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became known here. The president of the society came to see him, promised to speak to the inister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did so.—“Why, what!” xclaimed the Minister, “I should think so! An old savant! a botanist! an noffensive man! Something must be done for him!” On the following day, M. abeuf received an invitation to dine with the Minister. Trembling with joy, he howed the letter to Mother Plutarque. “We are saved!” said he. On the day ppointed, he went to the Minister’s house. He perceived that his ragged cravat, is long, square coat, and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke o him, not even the Minister. About ten o’clock in the evening, while he was till waiting for a word, he heard the Minister’s wife, a beautiful woman in a ow-necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach, inquire: “Who is that old entleman?” He returned home on foot at midnight, in a driving rain-storm. He ad sold an Elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go thither.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.15#He had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes Laertius very night, before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek to enjoy the eculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no other enjoyment. Several eeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell ill. There is one thing sadder han having no money with which to buy bread at the baker’s and that is having o money to purchase drugs at the apothecary’s. One evening, the doctor had rdered a very expensive potion. And the malady was growing worse; a nurse was equired. M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there. The last olume had taken its departure. All that was left to him was Diogenes Laertius. e put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was the 4th of June, 832; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal’s successor, and returned ith one hundred francs. He laid the pile of five-franc pieces on the old erving-woman’s nightstand, and returned to his chamber without saying a ord.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.16#On the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturned ost in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge, sitting the hole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes vaguely fixed on the ithered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; the old man did not seem to erceive the fact.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.17#In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. They resembled hots and the clamors of a multitude.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.9.3.18#Father Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, and nquired:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.1#Of what is revolt composed? Of nothing and of everything. Of an electricity isengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly darting forth, of a wandering orce, of a passing breath. This breath encounters heads which speak, brains hich dream, souls which suffer, passions which burn, wretchedness which howls, nd bears them away.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.2#Whither?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.3#At random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity and the nsolence of others.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.4#Irritated convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations, nstincts of war which have been repressed, youthful courage which has been xalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste for change, the thirst for the nexpected, the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the osters for the new play, and love, the prompter’s whistle, at the theatre; the ague hatreds, rancors, disappointments, every vanity which thinks that destiny as bankrupted it; discomfort, empty dreams, ambitions that are hedged about, hoever hopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at the very bottom, the abble, that mud which catches fire,—such are the elements of revolt. That which s grandest and that which is basest; the beings who prowl outside of all ounds, awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants, vagabonds of the crossroads, hose who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold louds of heaven, those who, each day, demand their bread from chance and not rom toil, the unknown of poverty and nothingness, the bare-armed, the are-footed, belong to revolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt gainst any deed whatever on the part of the state, of life or of fate, is ripe or riot, and, as soon as it makes its appearance, he begins to quiver, and to eel himself borne away with the whirlwind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.5#Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms uddenly in certain conditions of temperature, and which, as it eddies about, ounts, descends, thunders, tears, razes, crushes, demolishes, uproots, bearing ith it great natures and small, the strong man and the feeble mind, the tree runk and the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him hom it strikes! It breaks the one against the other.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.6#It communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary ower. It fills the firstcomer with the force of events; it converts everything nto projectiles. It makes a cannon-ball of a rough stone, and a general of a orter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.7#If we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views, a little evolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System: revolt strengthens hose governments which it does not overthrow. It puts the army to the test; it onsecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws out the muscles of the police; it emonstrates the force of the social framework. It is an exercise in gymnastics; t is almost hygiene. Power is in better health after a revolt, as a man is fter a good rubbing down.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.8#Revolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.9#There is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself “good sense”; hilintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false and the true; xplanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, because it is mingled ith blame and excuse, thinks itself wisdom, and is often only pedantry. A whole olitical school called “the golden mean” has been the outcome of this. As etween cold water and hot water, it is the lukewarm water party. This school ith its false depth, all on the surface, which dissects effects without going ack to first causes, chides from its height of a demi-science, the agitation of he public square.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.10#If we listen to this school, “The riots which complicated the affair of 830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. The Revolution of uly had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky. They made the loudy sky reappear. They caused that revolution, at first so remarkable for its nanimity, to degenerate into a quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all rogress accomplished by fits and starts, there had been secret fractures; these iots rendered them perceptible. It might have been said: ‘Ah! this is broken.’ fter the Revolution of July, one was sensible only of deliverance; after the iots, one was conscious of a catastrophe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.11#“All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchange nto consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitates failures; no ore money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public credit shaken, industry isconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a discount, fear everywhere; ounter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs. It has been calculated that the first ay of a riot costs France twenty millions, the second day forty, the third ixty, a three days’ uprising costs one hundred and twenty millions, that is to ay, if only the financial result be taken into consideration, it is equivalent o a disaster, a shipwreck or a lost battle, which should annihilate a fleet of ixty ships of the line.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.12#“No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the avements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war of thickets: n the one there is the soul of forests, in the other the heart of cities; the ne has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne. Revolts have illuminated with a red lare all the most original points of the Parisian character, generosity, evotion, stormy gayety, students proving that bravery forms part of ntelligence, the National Guard invincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses f street urchins, contempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools and egions clashed together. After all, between the combatants, there was only a ifference of age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical men who died at he age of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their families. The army, always sad thing in civil wars, opposed prudence to audacity. Uprisings, while roving popular intrepidity, also educated the courage of the bourgeois.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.13#“This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the bloodshed dd the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness among the best men, onest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to evolution by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830 triumphing and saying: ‘We old you so!’ Add Paris enlarged, possibly, but France most assuredly iminished. Add, for all must needs be told, the massacres which have too often ishonored the victory of order grown ferocious over liberty gone mad. To sum up ll, uprisings have been disastrous.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.14#Thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie, that pproximation to the people, so willingly contents itself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.1.15#For our parts, we reject this word _uprisings_ as too large, and onsequently as too convenient. We make a distinction between one popular ovement and another popular movement. We do not inquire whether an uprising osts as much as a battle. Why a battle, in the first place? Here the question f war comes up. Is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity? And hen, are all uprisings calamities? And what if the revolt of July did cost a undred and twenty millions? The establishment of Philip V. in Spain cost France wo milliards. Even at the same price, we should prefer the 14th of July. owever, we reject these figures, which appear to be reasons and which are only ords. An uprising being given, we examine it by itself. In all that is said by he doctrinarian objection above presented, there is no question of anything but ffect, we seek the cause.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.2.head#CHAPTER II—THE ROOT OF THE MATTER
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.2.1#There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as nsurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the wrong, the ther is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones which are founded on ustice, it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps; then the whole rises and he necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms. In all uestions which result from collective sovereignty, the war of the whole against he fraction is insurrection; the attack of the fraction against the whole is evolt; according as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are ustly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the populace, is rong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of Vendémiaire. Alike in ppearance, fundamentally different in reality; the Swiss defend the false, onaparte defends the true. That which universal suffrage has effected in its iberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is the same in hings pertaining purely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, lear-sighted to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when irected against Terray and absurd when directed against Turgot. The destruction f machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of rails, the demolition of ocks, the false routes of multitudes, the refusal by the people of justice to rogress, Ramus assassinated by students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and toned,—that is revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome gainst Cicero,—that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,—that is nsurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against Christopher olumbus,—this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why? Because Alexander is oing for Asia with the sword that which Christopher Columbus is doing for merica with the compass; Alexander like Columbus, is finding a world. These ifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations of light, that all esistance in that case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits idelity to itself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for xample, anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in ontraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on he day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne, urns into _chouannerie_, and, from having been an insurrection against, becomes n uprising for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance! The contraband salt dealer scapes the royal gibbets, and with a rope’s end round his neck, mounts the hite cockade. “Death to the salt duties,” brings forth, “Long live the King!” he assassins of Saint-Barthélemy, the cut-throats of September, the anslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, the assassins of Madam amballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions f Jéhu, the chevaliers of Brassard,—behold an uprising. La Vendée is a grand, atholic uprising. The sound of right in movement is recognizable, it does not lways proceed from the trembling of excited masses; there are mad rages, there re cracked bells, all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of assions and ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show e in what direction you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you ay grow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Any ther sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a revolt; to etreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race. Insurrection is fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements which the uprising disturbs ive forth the spark of right. These pavements bequeath to the uprising only heir mud. Danton against Louis XIV. is insurrection; Hébert against Danton is evolt.

Cæsar is great, Tacitus is great; God spares these two reatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one another. The guardian of ustice, in striking Cæsar, might strike too hard and be unjust. God does not ill it. The great wars of Africa and Spain, the pirates of Sicily destroyed, ivilization introduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,—all this glory overs the Rubicon.

In questions of famine, riot, uzançais, for example, holds a true, pathetic, and just point of departure. evertheless, it remains a riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, it was rong in form.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.3.1#In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all minds for he last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and loomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripe for commotion. As we have aid, the great city resembles a piece of artillery; when it is loaded, it uffices for a spark to fall, and the shot is discharged. In June, 1832, the park was the death of General Lamarque.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.3.2#Lamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in succession, under he Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery requisite for the two pochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the bravery of the tribune. He was s eloquent as he had been valiant; a sword was discernible in his speech. Like oy, his predecessor, after upholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat etween the left and the extreme left, beloved of the people because he accepted he chances of the future, beloved of the populace because he had served the mperor well; he was, in company with Comtes Gérard and Drouet, one of apoleon’s marshals _in petto_. The treaties of 1815 removed him as a personal ffence. He hated Wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the ultitude; and, for seventeen years, he majestically preserved the sadness of aterloo, paying hardly any attention to intervening events. In his death agony, t his last hour, he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to im by the officers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word army_, Lamarque uttering the word _country_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.3.3#His death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, and by he government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Like everything hat is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. This is what took place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.3.4#On the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the day ppointed for Lamarque’s burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which the rocession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. This tumultuous network f streets was filled with rumors. They armed themselves as best they might. oiners carried off door-weights of their establishment “to break down doors.” ne of them had made himself a dagger of a stocking-weaver’s hook by breaking ff the hook and sharpening the stump. Another, who was in a fever “to attack,” lept wholly dressed for three days. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, ho asked him: “Whither are you going?” “Eh! well, I have no weapons.” “What hen?” “I’m going to my timber-yard to get my compasses.” “What for?” “I don’t now,” said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accosted some assing artisans: “Come here, you!” He treated them to ten sous’ worth of wine nd said: “Have you work?” “No.” “Go to Filspierre, between the Barrière haronne and the Barrière Montreuil, and you will find work.” At Filspierre’s hey found cartridges and arms. Certain well-known leaders were going the ounds, that is to say, running from one house to another, to collect their men. t Barthélemy’s, near the Barrière du Trône, at Capel’s, near the Petit-Chapeau, he drinkers accosted each other with a grave air. They were heard to say: “Have ou your pistol?” “Under my blouse.” “And you?” “Under my shirt.” In the Rue raversière, in front of the Bland workshop, and in the yard of the aison-Brulée, in front of tool-maker Bernier’s, groups whispered together. mong them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remained more than a week in ne shop, as the masters always discharged him “because they were obliged to ispute with him every day.” Mavot was killed on the following day at the arricade of the Rue Ménilmontant. Pretot, who was destined to perish also in he struggle, seconded Mavot, and to the question: “What is your object?” he eplied: _“Insurrection.”_ Workmen assembled at the corner of the Rue de Bercy, aited for a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for the Faubourg aint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged almost publicly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.3.5#On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, General amarque’s funeral procession traversed Paris with official military pomp, omewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with draped drums and eversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with their swords at their sides, scorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men. The officers of the nvalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurel branches. Then came an nnumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the sectionaries of the Friends of the eople, the Law School, the Medical School, refugees of all nationalities, and panish, Italian, German, and Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every ossible sort of banner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters and arpenters who were on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by heir paper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearly ll of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order and yet ith a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column. Squads chose hemselves leaders; a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view, seemed to ass the host in review, and the files separated before him. On the side alleys f the boulevards, in the branches of the trees, on balconies, in windows, on he roofs, swarmed the heads of men, women, and children; all eyes were filled ith anxiety. An armed throng was passing, and a terrified throng looked on.

Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the Place ouis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their head, cartridge-boxes illed and muskets loaded, all in readiness to march; in the Latin country and t the Jardin des Plantes, the Municipal Guard echelonned from street to street; t the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron of dragoons; at the Grève half of the 12th ight Infantry, the other half being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the élestins; and the courtyard of the Louvre full of artillery. The remainder of he troops were confined to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of he environs of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacing ultitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the anlieue.

That which predominated on the uncovered brows of the ajority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. Here and there, lso, in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions, there ere visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said: “Let us lunder!” There are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and ake clouds of mud rise through the water. A phenomenon to which “well drilled” olicemen are no strangers.

Long live the epublic!” marked the passage of the funeral train. At the Bastille, long files f curious and formidable people who descended from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, ffected a junction with the procession, and a certain terrible seething began o agitate the throng.

Two prodigious shouts went up: “Lamarque o the Pantheon!—Lafayette to the Town-hall!” Some young men, amid the eclamations of the throng, harnessed themselves and began to drag Lamarque in he hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz and Lafayette in a hackney-coach long the Quai Morland.

What took place during that fatal minute? No one can ay. It is the dark moment when two clouds come together. Some declare that a last of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the Arsenal, thers that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, hat three shots were suddenly discharged: the first killed Cholet, chief of the quadron, the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her indow, the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a woman screamed: “They are eginning too soon!” and all at once, a squadron of dragoons which had remained n the barracks up to this time, was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared words, through the Rue Bassompierre and the Boulevard Bourdon, sweeping all efore them.

On a single point the inhabitants resisted, at the corner of the Rue ainte-Avoye and the Rue Simon-Le-Franc, where they destroyed the barricade with heir own hands. At a single point the insurgents yielded; they abandoned a arricade begun in the Rue de Temple after having fired on a detachment of the ational Guard, and fled through the Rue de la Corderie. The detachment picked p in the barricade a red flag, a package of cartridges, and three hundred istol-balls. The National Guardsmen tore up the flag, and carried off its attered remains on the points of their bayonets.

In less than an hour, wenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the Halles lone. In the centre was that famous house No. 50, which was the fortress of eanne and her six hundred companions, and which, flanked on the one hand by a arricade at Saint-Merry, and on the other by a barricade of the Rue Maubuée, ommanded three streets, the Rue des Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue ubry-le-Boucher, which it faced. The barricades at right angles fell back, the ne of the Rue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue eoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable arricades in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at ont-Sainte-Geneviève; one in the Rue Ménilmontant, where was visible a orte-cochère torn from its hinges; another near the little bridge of the ôtel-Dieu made with an “écossais,” which had been unharnessed and overthrown, hree hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police.

Another, with a naked sword, a lue police cap on his head, placed sentinels. In the interior, beyond the arricades, the wine-shops and porters’ lodges were converted into guard-houses. therwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific military tactics. The arrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full of angles and turns, were admirably hosen; the neighborhood of the Halles, in particular, a network of streets more ntricate than a forest. The Society of the Friends of the People had, it was aid, undertaken to direct the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A man illed in the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of aris.

The insurrection had abruptly built arricades with one hand, and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the arrison. In less than three hours, like a train of powder catching fire, the nsurgents had invaded and occupied, on the right bank, the Arsenal, the ayoralty of the Place Royale, the whole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms anufactory, la Galiote, the Château-d’Eau, and all the streets near the Halles; n the left bank, the barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pélagie, the Place aubert, the powder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five ’clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of the Lingerie, of he Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Place des Victoires, and enaced the Bank, the Petits-Pères barracks, and the Post-Office.

Enormous patrols, composed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in ntire companies of the National Guard, and preceded by a commissary of police earing his scarf of office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The nsurgents, on their side, placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces, nd audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each side was atching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand, hesitated; the ight was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin began to make itself eard. The Minister of War at that time, Marshal Soult, who had seen Austerlitz, egarded this with a gloomy air.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.10.5.1#During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more than ne insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than the hysiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious uarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything,—it is only a iot,—and Paris has so many affairs on hand, that she does not put herself out or so small a matter. These colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles. hese immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd nd indescribable tranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences, when he shop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm, he contents imself with the remark:—

The rout was shaken, their ranks ere broken, all ran, fled, made their escape, some with shouts of attack, thers with the pallor of flight.

We know not. ho does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well up in all the opular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his own chirpings. An bserving urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and he voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory f the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves, a tribe contiguous to his own. e had, it appears, been for three months apprenticed to a printer. He had one ay executed a commission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a amin of letters.

His rothers in the evening, his father in the morning; that is what his night had een like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets at daybreak, he had returned in haste o the elephant, had artistically extracted from it the two brats, had shared ith them some sort of breakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, onfiding them to that good mother, the street, who had brought him up, almost ntirely. On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the vening, and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell: “I break a cane, therwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as they say at the court, I file off. f you don’t find papa and mamma, young ‘uns, come back here this evening. I’ll cramble you up some supper, and I’ll give you a shakedown.” The two children, icked up by some policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some ountebank, or having simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a aris, did not return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full of hese lost traces. Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve weeks had lapsed since that night. More than once he had scratched the back of his head nd said: “Where the devil are my two children?”

They were talking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, poken to the veteran of the riot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque hey had passed to the Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber nd soldier which Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched with rabesques, and which he would have entitled: “Dialogue between the razor and he sword.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.3.10#The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had een there:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.3.13#“I?” said the soldier, “ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, I eceived two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right arm at usterlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland, a thrust from a ayonet, there,—at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts, no matter where, at utzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.1#In the meantime, in the Marché Saint-Jean, where the post had already been isarmed, Gavroche had just “effected a junction” with a band led by Enjolras, ourfeyrac, Combeferre, and Feuilly. They were armed after a fashion. Bahorel nd Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the group. Enjolras had a ouble-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the gun of a National Guard bearing the umber of his legion, and in his belt, two pistols which his unbuttoned coat llowed to be seen, Jean Prouvaire an old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; ourfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword n his hand, marched at their head shouting: “Long live Poland!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.2#They reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked by he rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted them calmly:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.4#“Come along,” said Courfeyrac.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.5#Behind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was like a fish in ater in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged in the sort of words hich break everything. His waistcoat astounded a passer-by, who cried in ewilderment:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.7#“The reds, the reds!” retorted Bahorel. “A queer kind of fear, bourgeois. or my part I don’t tremble before a poppy, the little red hat inspires me with o alarm. Take my advice, bourgeois, let’s leave fear of the red to horned attle.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.8#He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most eaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a Lenten dmonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his “flock.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.11#And he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. From that nstant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.12#“Bahorel,” observed Enjolras, “you are wrong. You should have let that harge alone, he is not the person with whom we have to deal, you are wasting our wrath to no purpose. Take care of your supply. One does not fire out of the anks with the soul any more than with a gun.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.13#“Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras,” retorted Bahorel. “This bishop’s rose shocks me; I want to eat eggs without being permitted.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.14#This word, _Hercle_, struck Gavroche. He sought all occasions for earning, and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem. He inquired of im:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.16#Bahorel answered:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.4.18#Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard ho was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C. He shouted o him:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.5.1#Let us recount what had taken place.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.5.2#Enjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon, near the public torehouses, at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge. Enjolras, ourfeyrac, and Combeferre were among those who had taken to the Rue assompierre, shouting: “To the barricades!” In the Rue Lesdiguières they had et an old man walking along. What had attracted their attention was that the oodman was walking in a zig-zag, as though he were intoxicated. Moreover, he ad his hat in his hand, although it had been raining all the morning, and was aining pretty briskly at the very time. Courfeyrac had recognized Father abeuf. He knew him through having many times accompanied Marius as far as his oor. As he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the ld beadle-book-collector, and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of hat uproar, a couple of paces from the cavalry charges, almost in the midst of fusillade, hatless in the rain, and strolling about among the bullets, he had ccosted him, and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter f fire and the octogenarian:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.5.13#And he had set out to follow them. From that moment forth he had not ttered a word. His step had suddenly become firm; artisans had offered him heir arms; he had refused with a sign of the head. He advanced nearly to the ront rank of the column, with the movement of a man who is marching and the ountenance of a man who is sleeping.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.11.5.14#“What a fierce old fellow!” muttered the students. The rumor spread hrough the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,—an old egicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie.

The old Rue Mondétour ut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles. So that the abyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form, on a space three athoms square, between the Halles and the Rue Saint-Denis on the one hand, and etween the Rue du Cygne and the Rue des Prêcheurs on the other, seven islands f houses, oddly cut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise and hap-hazard, and arely separated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.

These uildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Rue de la etite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams running from one house o another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad, the pedestrian there alked on a pavement that was always wet, skirting little stalls resembling ellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops, excessive heaps of refuse, and ates armed with enormous, century-old gratings. The Rue Rambuteau has evastated all that.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.8#The name of Mondétour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that hole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still better expressed y the _Rue Pirouette_, which ran into the Rue Mondétour.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.9#The passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue de la hanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an longated funnel. At the end of this street, which was very short, he found urther passage barred in the direction of the Halles by a tall row of houses, nd he would have thought himself in a blind alley, had he not perceived on the ight and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape. This was he Rue Mondétour, which on one side ran into the Rue de Prêcheurs, and on the ther into the Rue du Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie. At the bottom of this ort of cul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right, there was to be een a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a sort of cape n the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, that an illustrious ine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before. This tavern reated a joyous noise in the very spot which old Theophilus described in the ollowing couplet:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.10#Là branle le squelette horrible D’un pauvre amant qui se pendit.47
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.11#The situation was good, and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there, rom father to son.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.12#In the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the Pot-aux-Roses_, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for its ign-board, a post (_poteau_) painted rose-color. In the last century, the orthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff chool, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the very table where egnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of gratitude, a bunch of Corinth rapes on the pink post. The keeper of the cabaret, in his joy, had changed his evice and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these ords: “At the Bunch of Corinth Grapes” (_“Au Raisin de Corinthe”_). Hence the ame of Corinthe. Nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The llipsis is the zig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the ot-aux-Roses. The last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longer cquainted even with the tradition, had the post painted blue.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.13#A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the first loor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase piercing the eiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broad daylight,—this as the style of this cabaret. A staircase with a trap-door in the lower room ed to the cellar. On the second floor were the lodgings of the Hucheloup amily. They were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a taircase, and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on he first floor. Under the roof, in two mansard attics, were the nests for the ervants. The kitchen shared the ground floor with the tap-room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.14#Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact is that e was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his ine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital thing which ould be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps, which he called _carpes u gras_. These were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the ime of Louis XVI., on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of able-cloths. People came thither from a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, ad seen fit to notify passers-by of this “specialty”; he had dipped a brush in pot of black paint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as well s a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall this remarkable nscription:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.15#CARPES HO GRAS.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.16#One winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to bliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which began the hird; this is what remained:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.18#Time and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had become a rofound piece of advice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.19#In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father Hucheloup nderstood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen, and that, esirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled Horace. And the striking thing bout it was, that that also meant: “Enter my wine-shop.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.20#Nothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondétour labyrinth was isembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably no longer exists at the resent moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have disappeared beneath he pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.21#As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the allying-point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who had iscovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the _Carpe horas_, and had eturned thither on account of the _Carpes au gras_. There they drank, there hey ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, they paid badly, they did ot pay at all, but they were always welcome. Father Hucheloup was a jovial ost.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.22#Hucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper with moustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered air, seemed to ish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people who entered his stablishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of erving them with soup. And yet, we insist upon the word, people were always elcome there. This oddity had attracted customers to his shop, and brought him oung men, who said to each other: “Come hear Father Hucheloup growl.” He had een a fencing-master. All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big oice, a good fellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior, he sked nothing better than to frighten you, very much like those snuff-boxes hich are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.24#About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret of tuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop. But the ooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had always been bad, ecame fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his friends continued to go o Corinthe,—out of pity, as Bossuet said.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.25#The Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic ecollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation. She had way of her own of saying things, which spiced her reminiscences of the village nd of her springtime. It had formerly been her delight, so she affirmed, to ear the _loups-de-gorge_ (_rouges-gorges_) _chanter dans les ogrepines_ _aubépines_)—to hear the redbreasts sing in the hawthorn-trees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.26#The hall on the first floor, where “the restaurant” was situated, was a arge and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and tables, nd with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached by a spiral taircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the atchway of a ship.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.27#This room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that was lways burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniture comported tself as though it had but three legs—the whitewashed walls had for their only rnament the following quatrain in honor of Mame Hucheloup:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.28#Elle étonne à dix pas, elle épouvente à deux, Une verrue habite en son nez asardeux; On tremble à chaque instant qu’elle ne vous la mouche Et qu’un beau our son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.48

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.1.30#Mame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning till night efore this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Two serving-maids, amed Matelote and Gibelotte,49 and who had never been known by any other names, elped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine, and the arious broths which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. atelote, large, plump, redhaired, and noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the efunct Hucheloup, was homelier than any mythological monster, be it what it ay; still, as it becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the istress, she was less homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, hite with a lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids, lways languid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude, he first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even the ther maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a vague and leepy smile.

I hate he human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in front of the big ublic library. That pile of oyster-shells which is called a library is isgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink! What scrawling! And all that as been written! What rascal was it who said that man was a featherless iped?51 And then, I met a pretty girl of my acquaintance, who is as beautiful s the spring, worthy to be called Floréal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as appy as the angels, because a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted ith small-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the watch or a protector as much as for a lover; cats chase mice as well as birds. Two onths ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic, she adjusted little brass ings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do you call it? She sewed, she had a amp bed, she dwelt beside a pot of flowers, she was contented. Now here she is bankeress. This transformation took place last night. I met the victim this orning in high spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is as retty to-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show in her face. oses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces left upon hem by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on earth. I call to itness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel, the symbol of air, the live, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the apple-tree which came nearest angling Adam with its pips, and the fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As or right, do you know what right is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects lusium, and demands what wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: ‘The rong that Alba did to you, the wrong that Fidenæ did to you, the wrong that the ques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were your neighbors. he Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness just as you do. You have tolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.’ Rome said: ‘You shall not take Clusium.’ rennus took Rome. Then he cried: ‘Væ victis!’ That is what right is. Ah! what easts of prey there are in this world! What eagles! It makes my flesh reep.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.2.34#“Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the grisette s an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other. So we elieve in nothing. There is but one reality: drink. Whatever your opinion may e in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, or in favor of the fat ock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little, drink. You talk to me of the oulevard, of that procession, _et cætera, et cætera_. Come now, is there going o be another revolution? This poverty of means on the part of the good God stounds me. He has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment. There is hitch, it won’t work. Quick, a revolution! The good God has his hands erpetually black with that cart-grease. If I were in his place, I’d be erfectly simple about it, I would not wind up my mechanism every minute, I’d ead the human race in a straightforward way, I’d weave matters mesh by mesh, ithout breaking the thread, I would have no provisional arrangements, I would ave no extraordinary repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances by eans of two motors, men and events. But, sad to say, from time to time, the xceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices neither for event or for men: among men geniuses are required, among events revolutions. Great ccidents are the law; the order of things cannot do without them; and, judging rom the apparition of comets, one would be tempted to think that Heaven itself inds actors needed for its performance. At the moment when one expects it the east, God placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star turns p, underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the death of Cæsar. Brutus eals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a comet. _Crac_, and behold n aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a great man; ’93 in big letters, apoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at the head of the poster. Ah! what a eautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes! Boum! Boum! xtraordinary show! Raise your eyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the tar as well as the drama. Good God, it is too much and not enough. These esources, gathered from exception, seem magnificence and poverty. My friends, rovidence has come down to expedients. What does a revolution prove? That God s in a quandry. He effects a _coup d‘état_ because he, God, has not been able o make both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in my conjectures as to ehovah’s fortune; and when I see so much distress in heaven and on earth, from he bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand ivres of income, when I see human destiny, which is very badly worn, and even oyal destiny, which is threadbare, witness the Prince de Condé hung, when I see inter, which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows, hen I see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the rests of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the rost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up, and o many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see so much isery everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich. The appearance exists, it is rue, but I feel that he is hard up. He gives a revolution as a tradesman whose oney-box is empty gives a ball. God must not be judged from appearances. eneath the gilding of heaven I perceive a poverty-stricken universe. Creation s bankrupt. That is why I am discontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is lmost night; ever since this morning I have been waiting for daylight to come; t has not come, and I bet that it won’t come all day. This is the inexactness f an ill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anything lse, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition, verything goes awry; the universe is a tease.

It humiliates me to hink that I am of the same age as that baldy. However, I criticise, but I do ot insult. The universe is what it is. I speak here without evil intent and to ase my conscience. Receive, Eternal Father, the assurance of my distinguished onsideration. Ah! by all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods of paradise, was not intended to be a Parisian, that is to say, to rebound forever, like a huttlecock between two battledores, from the group of the loungers to the group f the roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watching oriental houris all day ong, executing those exquisite Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dream of a haste man, or a Beauceron peasant, or a Venetian gentleman surrounded by entlewoman, or a petty German prince, furnishing the half of a foot-soldier to he Germanic confederation, and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches n his hedge, that is to say, his frontier. Those are the positions for which I as born! Yes, I have said a Turk, and I will not retract. I do not understand ow people can habitually take Turks in bad part; Mohammed had his good points; espect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques! et us not insult Mohammedanism, the only religion which is ornamented with a en-roost! Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a great piece of stupidity. nd it appears that they are going to fight, all those imbeciles, and to break ach other’s profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer, in the onth of June, when they might go off with a creature on their arm, to breathe he immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows! Really, people do commit ltogether too many follies. An old broken lantern which I have just seen at a ric-à-brac merchant’s suggests a reflection to my mind; it is time to enlighten he human race. Yes, behold me sad again. That’s what comes of swallowing an yster and a revolution the wrong way! I am growing melancholy once more. Oh! rightful old world.

By two o’clock in the afternoon, the table at which they sat as covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning on it, one in a flat opper candlestick which was perfectly green, the other in the neck of a cracked arafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and Bossuet to wine; Bossuet and Joly had onducted Grantaire back towards cheerfulness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.2.75#As for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer of reams, ever since midday. Wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with erious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter of inebriety, white magic and lack magic; wine is only white magic. Grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. he blackness of a terrible fit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from rresting him, attracted him. He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the eerglass. The beer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on and, and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight, he had had recourse o that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces the most errible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors, beer, brandy, and absinthe, hat the lead of the soul is composed. They are three grooms; the celestial utterfly is drowned in them; and there are formed there in a membranous smoke, aguely condensed into the wing of the bat, three mute furies, Nightmare, Night, nd Death, which hover about the slumbering Psyche.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.2.76#Grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase; far from it. He was remendously gay, and Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked glasses. Grantaire dded to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas, a peculiarity of esture; he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity, his arm forming a ight angle, and, with cravat untied, seated astride a stool, his full glass in is right hand, he hurled solemn words at the big maid-servant Matelote:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.2.77#“Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member of he French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup. Let us rink.”

Bossuet had the comprehensive glance of fasting Hannibal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.3.2#Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. There as not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of a flash of ightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables, area-doors, windows, linds, attic skylights, shutters of every description were closed, from the round floor to the roof. A terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her indow on two clothes-poles for drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of usketry. The wine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, hat the mob had rushed into it.—“Ah my God! Ah my God!” sighed Mame ucheloup.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.3.6#In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had been renched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of street had been npaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage, and overturned, the ray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this dray contained three barrels of lime, hich they placed beneath the piles of paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar rap, and all the widow Hucheloup’s empty casks were used to flank the barrels f lime; Feuilly, with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of ans, had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of ough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one nows where. The beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring ouse-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and Courfeyrac turned round, alf the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man. There is othing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by emolishing.

Go tell your husband that he oxed my daughter’s ears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wife’s.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.4.8#The rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought under their louses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles of vitriol, two or three arnival torches, and a basket filled with fire-pots, “left over from the King’s estival.” This festival was very recent, having taken place on the 1st of May. t was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg aint-Antoine named Pépin. They smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la hanvrerie, the lantern corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all the anterns in the surrounding streets, de Mondétour, du Cygne, des Prêcheurs, and e la Grande and de la Petite-Truanderie.

Two barricades ere now in process of construction at once, both of them resting on the orinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger shut off the Rue de la hanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondétour, on the side of the Rue de Cygne. his last barricade, which was very narrow, was constructed only of casks and aving-stones. There were about fifty workers on it; thirty were armed with uns; for, on their way, they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer’s hop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.4.10#Nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this roop.

There was one who was shouting: “Let us exterminate them to the ast man and die at the point of our bayonet.” This man had no bayonet. Another pread out over his coat the cross-belt and cartridge-box of a National uardsman, the cover of the cartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription n red worsted: _Public Order_. There were a great many guns bearing the numbers f the legions, few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this, ll ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young men, and bronzed longshoremen. ll were in haste; and as they helped each other, they discussed the possible hances. That they would receive succor about three o’clock in the morning—that hey were sure of one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayings with hich was mingled a sort of cordial joviality. One would have pronounced them rothers, but they did not know each other’s names. Great perils have this fine haracteristic, that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had een lighted in the kitchen, and there they were engaged in moulding into ullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and all the brass table-ware of the stablishment. In the midst of it all, they drank. Caps and buckshot were mixed ell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In the billiard-hall, Mame ucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variously modified by terror, which had tupefied one, rendered another breathless, and roused the third, were tearing p old dish-cloths and making lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three ushy-haired, jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the inen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.

He was a sort of lmost irritating ubiquity; no halt was possible with him. The enormous arricade felt him on its haunches. He troubled the loungers, he excited the dle, he reanimated the weary, he grew impatient over the thoughtful, he nspired gayety in some, and breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, ow pricking a student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew off gain, hovered over the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one party to nother, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole company; a fly on the mmense revolutionary coach.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.1#The journals of the day which said that that _nearly impregnable tructure_, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call it, eached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is, that it did ot exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It was built in such a manner hat the combatants could, at their will, either disappear behind it or dominate he barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row of aving-stones placed on top of each other and arranged as steps in the interior. n the outside, the front of the barricade, composed of piles of paving-stones nd casks bound together by beams and planks, which were entangled in the wheels f Anceau’s dray and of the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable spect.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.2#An aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made etween the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which was urthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at this point. The ole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes, and a red flag, astened to this pole, floated over the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.3#The little Mondétour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building, was ot visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt. Enjolras and ourfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment of the Rue ondétour which opens through the Rue des Prêcheurs an issue into the Halles, ishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible communication with the outside, and ot entertaining much fear of an attack through the dangerous and difficult treet of the Rue des Prêcheurs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.4#With the exception of this issue which was left free, and which constituted hat Folard in his strategical style would have termed a branch and taking into ccount, also, the narrow cutting arranged on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the nterior of the barricade, where the wine-shop formed a salient angle, presented n irregular square, closed on all sides. There existed an interval of twenty aces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background f the street, so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses, ll inhabited, but closed from top to bottom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.5#All this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than an hour, nd without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or a single ayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who still ventured at this our of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast a glance at the Rue de la hanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, and redoubled their pace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.6#The two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table was dragged ut of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table. Enjolras brought the quare coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. This coffer was filled with cartridges. hen the mob saw the cartridges, a tremor ran through the bravest, and a omentary silence ensued.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.7#Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.8#Each one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, and set about making thers with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel of powder, it tood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held in reserve.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.9#The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it had inally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no longer aid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again drew near, with elancholy undulations.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.10#They loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, with olemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the arricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des rêcheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.5.11#Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the guns oaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those redoubtable streets hrough which no one passed any longer, surrounded by those dumb houses which eemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated, enveloped in the eepening shades of twilight which was drawing on, in the midst of that silence hrough which something could be felt advancing, and which had about it omething tragic and terrifying, isolated, armed, determined, and tranquil.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.head#CHAPTER VII—THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.1#Night was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard was onfused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare, badly ustained and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged, was a sign that he Government was taking its time, and collecting its forces. These fifty men ere waiting for sixty thousand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.2#Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls on he threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche, who had set o making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light of two candles placed n the counter by way of precaution, on account of the powder which was cattered on the tables. These two candles cast no gleam outside. The insurgents ad, moreover, taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.3#Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with his artridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the tap-room and ad seated himself at the table which was the least lighted. A musket of large odel had fallen to his share, and he held it between his legs. Gavroche, who ad been, up to that moment, distracted by a hundred “amusing” things, had not ven seen this man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.4#When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes, admiring is gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the street urchin sprang to is feet. Any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment, would have seen hat he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents, ith singular attention; but, from the moment when he had entered this room, he ad fallen into a sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that as going on. The gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to step round him on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is fraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish countenance which was, at nce so impudent and so serious, so giddy and so profound, so gay and so eart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify: Ah bah! mpossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this be? no, it is not! but yes! hy, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his heels, clenched both fists in his ockets, moved his neck around like a bird, expended in a gigantic pout all the agacity of his lower lip. He was astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced, azzled. He had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, iscovering a Venus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur ecognizing a Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work, the nstinct which scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It was evident hat a great event had happened in Gavroche’s life.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.5#It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras ccosted him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.6#“You are small,” said Enjolras, “you will not be seen. Go out of the arricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the streets, nd come back and tell me what is going on.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.7#Gavroche raised himself on his haunches.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.8#“So the little chaps are good for something! that’s very lucky! I’ll go! In he meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big ones.” And avroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, as he indicated the an of the Rue des Billettes: “Do you see that big fellow there?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.9#“Well?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.10#“He’s a police spy.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.12#“It isn’t two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port Royal, here I was taking the air, by my ear.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.13#Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low one to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand. The man eft the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied by three others. The our men, four porters with broad shoulders, went and placed themselves without oing anything to attract his attention, behind the table on which the man of he Rue des Billettes was leaning with his elbows. They were evidently ready to url themselves upon him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.14#Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.15#“Who are you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.16#At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep into njolras’ clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter’s meaning. He smiled with smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic, and more resolute ould be seen in the world, and replied with haughty gravity:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.17#“I see what it is. Well, yes!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.18#“You are a police spy?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.20#“And your name?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.21#“Javert.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.22#Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, before avert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down, pinioned and earched.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.23#They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass, nd bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with this motto: Supervision and vigilance_, and on the other this note: “JAVERT, inspector of olice, aged fifty-two,” and the signature of the Prefect of Police of that day, . Gisquet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.24#Besides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained several gold ieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch, at the bottom of is fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope, which Enjolras unfolded, nd on which he read these five lines, written in the very hand of the Prefect f Police:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.25#“As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert will ake sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the malefactors have nstituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine, near the Jena bridge.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.26#The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behind is back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room hich had formerly given the wine-shop its name.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.12.7.27#Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved of verything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert and said to im:—

Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by Enjolras, ombeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearing the jacket of a treet porter, which was very threadbare on the shoulders, who gesticulated and ociferated, and who had the look of a drunken savage. This man, whose name or ickname was Le Cabuc, and who was, moreover, an utter stranger to those who retended to know him, was very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, nd had seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged utside of the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him drunk eemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of he barricade, whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the Rue aint-Denis.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.1#The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the barricade f the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect of the voice of estiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presented itself; he knocked at the oor of the tomb, a hand in the darkness offered him the key. These melancholy penings which take place in the gloom before despair, are tempting. Marius hrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass, emerged from the arden, and said: “I will go.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.2#Mad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his rain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two onths passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed at once by all he reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining, to make a speedy end f all.

The shops were open there, the gas was urning under the arcades, women were making their purchases in the stalls, eople were eating ices in the Café Laiter, and nibbling small cakes at the nglish pastry-cook’s shop. Only a few posting-chaises were setting out at a allop from the Hôtel des Princes and the Hôtel Meurice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.6#Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honoré through the Passage Delorme. There the hops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of their half-open oors, people were walking about, the street lanterns were lighted, beginning ith the first floor, all the windows were lighted as usual. There was cavalry n the Place du Palais-Royal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.7#Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honoré. In proportion as he left the alais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shops were fast hut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grew sombre, and, at the ame time, the crowd increased in density. For the passers-by now amounted to a rowd. No one could be seen to speak in this throng, and yet there arose from it dull, deep murmur.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.8#Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were “assemblages”, motionless nd gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst f running water.

It ormed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable block of people ho were huddled together, and conversing in low tones. There were hardly any lack coats or round hats now, but smock frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling nd cadaverous heads. This multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal loom. Its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of hem was walking, a dull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense ortion of the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in he extension of the Rue Saint-Honoré, there was no longer a single window in hich a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns ould be seen vanishing into the street in the distance. The lanterns of that ate resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, and shed upon the pavement a hadow which had the form of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted. here could be descried piles of guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. o curious observer passed that limit. There circulation ceased. There the abble ended and the army began.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.10#Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had been ummoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the ivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the sentinels. He made circuit, reached the Rue de Béthisy, and directed his course towards the alles. At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais, there were no longer any anterns.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.11#After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits of the roops; he found himself in something startling.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.1.14#Proceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he judged to e the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came in contact ith an obstacle. He extended his hands. It was an overturned wagon; his foot ecognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stones scattered and piled up. A arricade had been begun there and abandoned. He climbed over the stones and ound himself on the other side of the barrier. He walked very near the treet-posts, and guided himself along the walls of the houses. A little beyond he barricade, it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front f him. He approached, it took on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of he omnibus harnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying at random ll day from street to street, and had finally halted there, with the weary atience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men, than man nderstands the actions of Providence.

As he was approaching a street which eemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one knows hence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by him, and the ullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his head over a airdresser’s shop.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.2.2#All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city, hrough which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousand lanes ross, and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold, ould have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the entre of Paris. There the glance fell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken anterns, thanks to the closed windows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, ll movement ceased. The invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch verywhere, and maintained order, that is to say, night. The necessary tactics f insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiply very combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains. At dusk, very window where a candle was burning received a shot. The light was xtinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was stirring. here was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; and in the treets, a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long rows of windows and stores, he indentations of the chimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflections which re cast back by the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eye cast upward t that mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and there, at ntervals, of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines, nd profiles of singular buildings, something like the lights which go and come n ruins; it was at such points that the barricades were situated. The rest was lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, and funereal, above which, in motionless and elancholy outlines, rose the tower of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, nd two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the ight makes phantoms.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.2.3#All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters where he Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a few street anterns still burned, the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic leam of swords and bayonets, the dull rumble of artillery, and the swarming of ilent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute; a formidable irdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.2.4#The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern; verything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as we have just seen, ny street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.2.5#A wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable shocks, into hich it was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible to remain, here those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited, where those who aited shuddered before those who were coming. Invisible combatants were ntrenched at every corner of the street; snares of the sepulchre concealed in he density of night. All was over. No more light was to be hoped for, enceforth, except the lightning of guns, no further encounter except the abrupt nd rapid apparition of death. Where? How? When? No one knew, but it was certain nd inevitable. In this place which had been marked out for the struggle, the overnment and the insurrection, the National Guard, and popular societies, the ourgeois and the uprising, groping their way, were about to come into contact. he necessity was the same for both. The only possible issue thenceforth was to merge thence killed or conquerors. A situation so extreme, an obscurity so owerful, that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution, and the ost daring with terror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.2.6#Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination were qual. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed of etreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed of light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.2.7#It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, that riumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection should prove tself a revolution or a skirmish. The Government understood this as well as the arties; the most insignificant bourgeois felt it. Hence a thought of anguish hich mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the oint of being decided; hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a atastrophe was on the point of emerging. Here only one sound was audible, a ound as heart-rending as the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the ocsin of Saint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor of hat wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.2#There everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless than in he neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial peace of the epulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.3#Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the ofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the aint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the orinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards that red light. It had rawn him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth f the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered it. The insurgents’ sentinel, who was uarding the other end, did not see him. He felt that he was very close to that hich he had come in search of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he eached the elbow of that short section of the Rue Mondétour which was, as the eader will remember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with he outside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrust his ead forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondétour.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.7#Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms, and ell to thinking about his father.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.8#He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud a oldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, and had ouched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa, Alexandria, ilan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who had left on all the ictorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that same blood, which he, Marius, ad in his veins, who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command, ho had lived with his sword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, is cockade blackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, in arracks, in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration of wenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, a smiling ountenance, tranquil, admirable, pure as a child, having done everything for rance and nothing against her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.9#He said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour had truck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself brave, ntrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast to bayonets, to hed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that he was about to wage war n his turn and descend to the field of battle, and that the field of battle pon which he was to descend was the street, and that the war in which he was bout to engage was civil war!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.10#He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and into this he was bout to fall. Then he shuddered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.11#He thought of his father’s sword, which his grandfather had sold to a econd-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. He said to himself hat that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him, and to epart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus fled, it was because it was ntelligent and because it had foreseen the future; that it had had a resentiment of this rebellion, the war of the gutters, the war of the avements, fusillades through cellar-windows, blows given and received in the ear; it was because, coming from Marengo and Friedland, it did not wish to go o the Rue de la Chanvrerie; it was because, after what it had done with the ather, it did not wish to do this for the son! He told himself that if that word were there, if after taking possession of it at his father’s pillow, he ad dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between renchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst ut aflame before his eyes, like the sword of the angel! He told himself that it as fortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared, that that was ell, that that was just, that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his ather’s glory, and that it was far better that the colonel’s sword should be old at auction, sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old junk, than hat it should, to-day, wound the side of his country.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.12#And then he fell to weeping bitterly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.13#This was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he could ot. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he not given her his word of onor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; this meant that it pleased er that Marius should die. And then, it was clear that she no longer loved him, ince she had departed thus without warning, without a word, without a letter, lthough she knew his address! What was the good of living, and why should he ive now? And then, what! should he retreat after going so far? should he flee rom danger after having approached it? should he slip away after having come nd peeped into the barricade? slip away, all in a tremble, saying: “After all, have had enough of it as it is. I have seen it, that suffices, this is civil ar, and I shall take my leave!” Should he abandon his friends who were xpecting him? Who were in need of him possibly! who were a mere handful against n army! Should he be untrue at once to his love, to country, to his word? hould he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism? But this was mpossible, and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom, and beheld im retreating, he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword, and hout to him: “March on, you poltroon!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.14#Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped his ead.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.15#All at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had just been ffected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought which is eculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly to be near eath. The vision of the action into which he felt that he was, perhaps, on the oint of entering, appeared to him no more as lamentable, but as superb. The war f the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of is soul, before the eye of his thought. All the tumultuous interrogation points f reverie recurred to him in throngs, but without troubling him. He left none f them unanswered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.16#Let us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there not cases where nsurrection rises to the dignity of duty? What was there that was degrading for he son of Colonel Pontmercy in the combat which was about to begin? It is no onger Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is something quite different. The question s no longer one of sacred territory,—but of a holy idea. The country wails, hat may be, but humanity applauds. But is it true that the country does wail? rance bleeds, but liberty smiles; and in the presence of liberty’s smile, rance forgets her wound. And then if we look at things from a still more lofty oint of view, why do we speak of civil war?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.17#Civil war—what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war etween men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object. There is o such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just and unjust war. Until hat day when the grand human agreement is concluded, war, that at least which s the effort of the future, which is hastening on against the past, which is agging in the rear, may be necessary. What have we to reproach that war with? ar does not become a disgrace, the sword does not become a disgrace, except hen it is used for assassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization, ruth. Then war, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime. utside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does one form of man espise another? By what right should the sword of Washington disown the pike of amille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the stranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, hich is the greater? the one is the defender, the other the liberator. Shall we rand every appeal to arms within a city’s limits without taking the object into consideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von lankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? That was the ar of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought gainst Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against he Moors; all against the foreigner. Well, the monarchy is a foreigner; ppression is a stranger; the right divine is a stranger. Despotism violates the oral frontier, an invasion violates the geographical frontier. Driving out the yrant or driving out the English, in both cases, regaining possession of one’s wn territory. There comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices; after hilosophy, action is required; live force finishes what the idea has sketched ut; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; the encyclopedia enlightens ouls, the 10th of August electrifies them. After Æschylus, Thrasybulus; after iderot, Danton. Multitudes have a tendency to accept the master. Their mass ears witness to apathy. A crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience. Men must e stirred up, pushed on, treated roughly by the very benefit of their eliverance, their eyes must be wounded by the true, light must be hurled at hem in terrible handfuls. They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at heir own well-being; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity of tocsins nd wars. Great combatants must rise, must enlighten nations with audacity, and hake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine, æsarian glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power, and absolute majesty; a abble stupidly occupied in the contemplation, in their twilight splendor, of hese sombre triumphs of the night. Down with the tyrant! Of whom are you peaking? Do you call Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis XVI. oth of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings; but rinciples are not to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is rectilinear, he peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance; no concessions, then; ll encroachments on man should be repressed. There is a divine right in Louis VI., there is _because a Bourbon_ in Louis Philippe; both represent in a ertain measure the confiscation of right, and, in order to clear away universal nsurrection, they must be combated; it must be done, France being always the ne to begin. When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short, hat cause is more just, and consequently, what war is greater, than that which e-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores the people o the people, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head of rance, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every germ of ntagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates the obstacle which oyalty presents to the whole immense universal concord, and places the human ace once more on a level with the right? These wars build up peace. An enormous ortress of prejudices, privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, iolences, iniquities, and darkness still stands erect in this world, with its owers of hatred. It must be cast down. This monstrous mass must be made to rumble. To conquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille is immense.

Logic is mingled ith convulsion, and the thread of the syllogism floats, without breaking, in he mournful storm of thought. This was the situation of Marius’ mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.13.3.19#As he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in every irection, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about to do, his glance trayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgents were here conversing in low voice, without moving, and there was perceptible that quasi-silence which arks the last stage of expectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third tory Marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly ttentive. This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc. Below, by the ights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones, this head could e vaguely distinguished. Nothing could be stranger, in that sombre and ncertain gleam, than that livid, motionless, astonished face, with its ristling hair, its eyes fixed and staring, and its yawning mouth, bent over the treet in an attitude of curiosity. One would have said that the man who was ead was surveying those who were about to die. A long trail of blood which had lowed from that head, descended in reddish threads from the window to the eight of the first floor, where it stopped.

They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and the vidette f the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the Lane des Prêcheurs had emained at his post, which indicated that nothing was approaching from the irection of the bridges and Halles.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.17#Forty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, ossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling inside the large barricade, ith their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier, the barrels of their uns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loop-holes, attentive, mute, eady to fire. Six, commanded by Feuilly, had installed themselves, with their uns levelled at their shoulders, at the windows of the two stories of orinthe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.18#Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy, nd numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu. This ound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous, approached slowly, ithout halt, without intermission, with a tranquil and terrible continuity. othing was to be heard but this. It was that combined silence and sound, of the tatue of the commander, but this stony step had something indescribably normous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the ame time, the idea of a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue egion marching onward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and stopped. t seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the treet. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that dense bscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads, as fine s needles and almost imperceptible, which moved about like those indescribable hosphoric networks which one sees beneath one’s closed eyelids, in the first ists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep. These were ayonets and gun-barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the orch.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.19#A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from the epths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, since no one as visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking, shouted:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.26#A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell. The ischarge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff, that is to ay, the very tip of the omnibus pole.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.27#Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the arricade and wounded several men.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.28#The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The attack ad been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest. It was vident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very least.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.1.35#Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when, ithout any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply death. The ravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation. Enjolras himself felt a hrill. He repeated:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.1#Since they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of the arricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf had not uitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground floor of the wine-shop and ad seated himself behind the counter. There he had, so to speak, retreated into imself. He no longer seemed to look or to think. Courfeyrac and others had ccosted him two or three times, warning him of his peril, beseeching him to ithdraw, but he did not hear them. When they were not speaking to him, his outh moved as though he were replying to some one, and as soon as he was ddressed, his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance f being alive.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.2#Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an attitude hich he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted on his knees and is head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice. Nothing had een able to move him from this attitude; it did not seem as though his mind ere in the barricade. When each had gone to take up his position for the ombat, there remained in the tap-room where Javert was bound to the post, only single insurgent with a naked sword, watching over Javert, and himself, abeuf. At the moment of the attack, at the detonation, the physical shock had eached him and had, as it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed he room, and at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: “Does no one olunteer?” the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the ine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups. A hout went up:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.3#“It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! It is the epresentative of the people!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.4#It is probable that he did not hear them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.5#He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before him ith a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled in amazement nd then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him, this old man of eighty, ith shaking head but firm foot, began slowly to ascend the staircase of aving-stones arranged in the barricade. This was so melancholy and so grand hat all around him cried: “Off with your hats!” At every step that he mounted, t was a frightful spectacle; his white locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, ald, and wrinkled brow, his amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the ed banner, rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the orch, and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of ’93 emerging rom the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.6#When he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terrible hantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred nvisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as though he were more owerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness, a supernatural nd colossal form.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.7#There ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of rodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flag and houted:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.2.9#Those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper, like the murmur of a riest who is despatching a prayer in haste. It was probably the commissary of olice who was making the legal summons at the other end of the street.

But he had not long een able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be esignated as the call of the abyss. In the presence of the imminence of the eril, in the presence of the death of M.

At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, a hand was laid on the uzzle of the gun and obstructed it. This was done by some one who had darted orward,—the young workman in velvet trousers. The shot sped, traversed the hand nd possibly, also, the workman, since he fell, but the ball did not strike arius. All this, which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the moke, Marius, who was entering the tap-room, hardly noticed. Still, he had, in confused way, perceived that gun-barrel aimed at him, and the hand which had locked it, and he had heard the discharge. But in moments like this, the things hich one sees vacillate and are precipitated, and one pauses for nothing. One eels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still, and all is cloud.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.9#“You are he!” said Enjolras.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.10#Marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long; now it was a hirlwind. This whirlwind which was within him, produced on him the effect of eing outside of him and of bearing him away. It seemed to him that he was lready at an immense distance from life. His two luminous months of joy and ove, ending abruptly at that frightful precipice, Cosette lost to him, that arricade, M. Mabeuf getting himself killed for the Republic, himself the leader f the insurgents,—all these things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare. e was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that urrounded him was real. Marius had already seen too much of life not to know hat nothing is more imminent than the impossible, and that what it is always ecessary to foresee is the unforeseen. He had looked on at his own drama as a iece which one does not understand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.11#In the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did not recognize Javert, ho, bound to his post, had not so much as moved his head during the whole of he attack on the barricade, and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him ith the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge. Marius had not even een him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.12#In the meanwhile, the assailants did not stir, they could be heard arching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not venture nto it, either because they were awaiting orders or because they were awaiting einforcements before hurling themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt. The nsurgents had posted sentinels, and some of them, who were medical students, et about caring for the wounded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.13#They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception of the wo tables reserved for lint and cartridges, and of the one on which lay Father abeuf; they had added them to the barricade, and had replaced them in the ap-room with mattresses from the bed of the widow Hucheloup and her servants. n these mattresses they had laid the wounded. As for the three poor creatures ho inhabited Corinthe, no one knew what had become of them. They were finally ound, however, hidden in the cellar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.14#A poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.15#The roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who was it? ne of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.5.19#“Well,” resumed Combeferre, “I am going to fasten my handkerchief to my ane, and go as a flag of truce, to offer to exchange our man for theirs.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.1#A peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the barricades s almost always made from the front, and that the assailants generally abstain rom turning the position, either because they fear ambushes, or because they re afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets. The insurgents’ whole ttention had been directed, therefore, to the grand barricade, which was, vidently, the spot always menaced, and there the struggle would infallibly ecommence. But Marius thought of the little barricade, and went thither. It was eserted and guarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between the aving-stones. Moreover, the Mondétour alley, and the branches of the Rue de la etite Truanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.2#As Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, he heard his ame pronounced feebly in the darkness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.3#“Monsieur Marius!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.4#He started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours efore through the gate in the Rue Plumet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.5#Only, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.6#He looked about him, but saw no one.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.7#Marius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added by his ind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him. He advanced step, in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.8#“Monsieur Marius!” repeated the voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.9#This time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly; he looked and aw nothing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.10#“At your feet,” said the voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.11#He bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself owards him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.12#It was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to im.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.13#The fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers of coarse elvet, bare feet, and something which resembled a pool of blood. Marius ndistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was aying to him:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.14#“You do not recognize me?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.15#“No.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.16#“Éponine.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.17#Marius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. She was ressed in men’s clothes.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.19#“I am dying,” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.20#There are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings. Marius cried ut with a start:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.21#“You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will attend o you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in order not to hurt ou? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! But why did you come hither?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.22#And he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.23#She uttered a feeble cry.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.24#“Have I hurt you?” asked Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.25#“A little.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.26#“But I only touched your hand.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.27#She raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius saw a lack hole.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.28#“What is the matter with your hand?” said he.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.29#“It is pierced.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.30#“Pierced?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.32#“What with?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.33#“A bullet.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.37#“It was mine.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.38#Marius was seized with a shudder.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.39#“What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it is othing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; one does not die f a pierced hand.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.40#She murmured:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.42#He obeyed; she laid her head on Marius’ knees, and, without looking at im, she said:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.44#She remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with an effort, nd looked at Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.45#“Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you entered that arden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you that house; and then, I ught to have said to myself that a young man like you—”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.46#She paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly xisted in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.47#“You thought me ugly, didn’t you?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.48#She continued:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.49#“You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It was I ho led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon that. And yet, hen I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the muzzle of the gun. How ueer it is! But it was because I wanted to die before you. When I received that ullet, I dragged myself here, no one saw me, no one picked me up, I was waiting or you, I said: ‘So he is not coming!’ Oh, if you only knew. I bit my blouse, I uffered so! Now I am well. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and hen I looked at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on the oulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long time ago. ou gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: ‘I don’t want your money.’ I hope ou picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did not think to tell you to pick t up.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.50#She had a mad, grave, and heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse disclosed er bare throat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.51#As she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there was nother hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream of blood, ike a jet of wine from an open bung-hole.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.52#Marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.53#“Oh!” she resumed, “it is coming again, I am stifling!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.54#She caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on the avement.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.55#At that moment the young cock’s crow executed by little Gavroche resounded hrough the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.56#The child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly the ong then so popular:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.60#And turning to Marius:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.62#“Your brother?” inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter and orrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thénardiers which his father ad bequeathed to him; “who is your brother?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.63#“That little fellow.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.67#“Oh! don’t go away,” said she, “it will not be long now.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.68#She was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken by iccoughs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.69#At intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as near hat of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.70#“Listen, I do not wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my pocket or you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not want to have it each you. But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again resently? Take your letter.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.71#She grasped Marius’ hand convulsively with her pierced hand, but she no onger seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius’ hand in the pocket of her louse. There, in fact, Marius felt a paper.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.72#“Take it,” said she.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.73#Marius took the letter.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.76#And she stopped.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.6.81#She dropped her head again on Marius’ knees, and her eyelids closed. He hought the poor soul had departed. Éponine remained motionless. All at once, at he very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, she slowly opened her yes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death, and said to him in a tone hose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.1#Marius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where the cy perspiration stood in beads.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.2#This was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and pensive farewell to n unhappy soul.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.3#It was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which Éponine had iven him. He had immediately felt that it was an event of weight. He was mpatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted that the unhappy child ad hardly closed her eyes when Marius began to think of unfolding this aper.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.4#He laid her gently on the ground, and went away. Something told him that he ould not peruse that letter in the presence of that body.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.5#He drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, folded and ealed with a woman’s elegant care. The address was in a woman’s hand and an:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.6#“To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac’s, Rue de la errerie, No. 16.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.7#He broke the seal and read:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.8#“My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We hall be this evening in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week we shall be n England. COSETTE. June 4th.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.9#Such was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even acquainted ith Cosette’s handwriting.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.10#What had taken place may be related in a few words. Éponine had been the ause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherished a ouble idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house f the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and Cosette. She had exchanged rags ith the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress ike a woman, while Éponine disguised herself like a man. It was she who had onveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: “Leave our house.” Jean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to Cosette: We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l’Homme Armé with Toussaint. ext week, we shall be in London.” Cosette, utterly overwhelmed by this nexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of lines to Marius. But how was she o get the letter to the post? She never went out alone, and Toussaint, urprised at such a commission, would certainly show the letter to M. auchelevent. In this dilemma, Cosette had caught sight through the fence of ponine in man’s clothes, who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette ad called to “this young workman” and had handed him five francs and the etter, saying: “Carry this letter immediately to its address.” Éponine had put he letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went to ourfeyrac’s quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of delivering he letter, but,—a thing which every jealous and loving soul will omprehend,—“to see.” There she had waited for Marius, or at least for ourfeyrac, still for the purpose of _seeing_. When Courfeyrac had told her: “We re going to the barricades,” an idea flashed through her mind, to fling herself nto that death, as she would have done into any other, and to thrust Marius nto it also. She had followed Courfeyrac, had made sure of the locality where he barricade was in process of construction; and, quite certain, since Marius ad received no warning, and since she had intercepted the letter, that he would o at dusk to his trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to he Rue Plumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of his riends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade. She eckoned on Marius’ despair when he should fail to find Cosette; she was not istaken. She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself. What she did here the reader has just seen. She died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts ho drag the beloved being into their own death, and who say: “No one shall have im!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.11#Marius covered Cosette’s letter with kisses. So she loved him! For one oment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Then he said to imself: “She is going away. Her father is taking her to England, and my randfather refuses his consent to the marriage. Nothing is changed in our ates.” Dreamers like Marius are subject to supreme attacks of dejection, and esperate resolves are the result. The fatigue of living is insupportable; death s sooner over with. Then he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil: o inform Cosette of his death and send her a final farewell, and to save from he impending catastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child, Éponine’s rother and Thénardier’s son.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.12#He had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained the ote-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for Cosette. He ore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.13#“Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I have o fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no longer there. hou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep it. I die. I love thee. hen thou readest this, my soul will be near thee, and thou wilt smile.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.14#Having nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself with olding the paper in four, and added the address:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.14.7.15#“To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent’s, Rue de ’Homme Armé, No. 7.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.1#What are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections of he soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean at that ery moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort of gulf had opened gain within him. He also was trembling, like Paris, on the brink of an obscure nd formidable revolution. A few hours had sufficed to bring this about. His estiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered with gloom. Of him also, as ell as of Paris, it might have been said: “Two principles are face to face. The hite angel and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of he abyss. Which of the two will hurl the other over? Who will carry the ay?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.2#On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean, accompanied y Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue de l’Homme Armé. A hange awaited him there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.3#Cosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort at esistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side, Cosette’s will nd the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct, and had been in pposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There had been objections on one ide and inflexibility on the other. The abrupt advice: “Leave your house,” urled at Jean Valjean by a stranger, had alarmed him to the extent of rendering im peremptory. He thought that he had been traced and followed. Cosette had een obliged to give way.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.4#Both had arrived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé without opening their lips, and ithout uttering a word, each being absorbed in his own personal preoccupation; ean Valjean so uneasy that he did not notice Cosette’s sadness, Cosette so sad hat she did not notice Jean Valjean’s uneasiness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.5#Jean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he had never done n his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of not returning to the ue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behind nor confide his secret o her. Besides, he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy. Treachery between aster and servant begins in curiosity. Now Toussaint, as though she had been estined to be Jean Valjean’s servant, was not curious. She stammered in her easant dialect of Barneville: “I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no ffair of mine.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.6#In this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost a flight, Jean aljean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise, baptized by osette “the inseparable.” Full trunks would have required porters, and porters re witnesses. A fiacre had been summoned to the door on the Rue de Babylone, nd they had taken their departure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.7#It was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission to pack up a ittle linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. Cosette had taken only her ortfolio and her blotting-book.

They had rrived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé after night had fully fallen.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.10#The lodgings in the Rue de l’Homme Armé were situated on a back court, on he second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, a dining-room and a itchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garret where there was a folding-bed, nd which fell to Toussaint’s share. The dining-room was an antechamber as well, nd separated the two bedrooms. The apartment was provided with all necessary tensils.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.11#People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature is o constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l’Homme Armé when his nxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. There are soothing spots which ct in some sort mechanically on the mind. An obscure street, peaceable nhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity n that alley of ancient Paris, which is so narrow that it is barred against arriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts, which is deaf and dumb in he midst of the clamorous city, dimly lighted at midday, and is, so to speak, ncapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold heir peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant oblivion in hat street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there. How could he be found here?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.12#His first care was to place _the inseparable_ beside him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.13#He slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On the ollowing morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought the ining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an old round table, long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, a dilapidated armchair, and everal plain chairs which were encumbered with Toussaint’s packages. In one of hese packages Jean Valjean’s uniform of a National Guard was visible through a ent.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.14#As for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, and did ot make her appearance until evening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.15#About five o’clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and busying erself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken, which osette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.16#That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache, had ade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber. Jean aljean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite, and with his lbows on the table, having gradually recovered his serenity, had regained ossession of his sense of security.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.17#While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice, oticed in a confused way, Toussaint’s stammering words as she said to him: Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in Paris.” But bsorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid no heed to it. To tell he truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began to pace from the door to the indow and from the window to the door, growing ever more serene.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.18#With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts. Not hat he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a young girl’s it of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be nothing left of it in a day r two; but he meditated on the future, and, as was his habit, he thought of it ith pleasure. After all, he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its ourse. At certain hours, everything seems impossible, at others everything ppears easy; Jean Valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours. They enerally succeed the bad ones, as day follows night, by virtue of that law of uccession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature, and hich superficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street where he had aken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some ime past. This very fact, that he had seen many shadows, made him begin to erceive a little azure. To have quitted the Rue Plumet without complications or ncidents was one good step already accomplished. Perhaps it would be wise to go broad, if only for a few months, and to set out for London. Well, they would o. What difference did it make to him whether he was in France or in England, rovided he had Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation. Cosette sufficed for is happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did not suffice for Cosette’s appiness, that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and leeplessness, did not even present itself to his mind. He was in a state of ollapse from all his past sufferings, and he was fully entered on optimism. osette was by his side, she seemed to be his; an optical illusion which every ne has experienced. He arranged in his own mind, with all sorts of felicitous evices, his departure for England with Cosette, and he beheld his felicity econstituted wherever he pleased, in the perspective of his reverie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.19#As he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenly encountered omething strange.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.20#In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he saw he four lines which follow:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.21#“My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We hall be this evening in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week we shall be n England. COSETTE. June 4th.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.22#Jean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.23#Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard in ront of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, had forgotten t and left it there, without even observing that she had left it wide open, and pen at precisely the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she ad penned, and which she had given in charge of the young workman in the Rue lumet. The writing had been printed off on the blotter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.24#The mirror reflected the writing.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.25#The result was, what is called in geometry, _the symmetrical image_; so hat the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror and resented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean had beneath his eyes the etter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.27#Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again, but e did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of appearing in a flash f lightning. It was a hallucination, it was impossible. It was not so.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.28#Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked at osette’s blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned to him. e caught up the blotter and said: “It comes from there.” He feverishly examined he four lines imprinted on the blotter, the reversal of the letters converted nto an odd scrawl, and he saw no sense in it. Then he said to himself: “But his signifies nothing; there is nothing written here.” And he drew a long reath with inexpressible relief. Who has not experienced those foolish joys in orrible instants? The soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted ll illusions.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.29#He held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight, lmost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe. All at nce his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again he beheld the vision. There ere the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness. This time it was no irage. The recurrence of a vision is a reality; it was palpable, it was the riting restored in the mirror. He understood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.30#Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the old armchair eside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in utter bewilderment. e told himself that it was plain, that the light of the world had been eclipsed orever, and that Cosette had written that to some one. Then he heard his soul, hich had become terrible once more, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try hen the effect of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.31#Strange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet received osette’s letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean Valjean before elivering it to Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean had not been vanquished by rial. He had been subjected to fearful proofs; no violence of bad fortune had een spared him; the ferocity of fate, armed with all vindictiveness and all ocial scorn, had taken him for her prey and had raged against him. He had ccepted every extremity when it had been necessary; he had sacrificed his nviolability as a reformed man, had yielded up his liberty, risked his head, ost everything, suffered everything, and he had remained disinterested and toical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from imself like a martyr. His conscience inured to every assault of destiny, might ave appeared to be forever impregnable. Well, any one who had beheld his piritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that oment. It was because, of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course f this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him, this was the most errible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto. He felt the mysterious tirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt the plucking at the strange hord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us say rather, the only trial, is the loss f the beloved being.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.32#Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than as a ather; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity the idowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; he loved Cosette as is daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and he loved her as his sister; nd, as he had never had either a woman to love or a wife, as nature is a reditor who accepts no protest, that sentiment also, the most impossible to ose, was mingled with the rest, vague, ignorant, pure with the purity of lindness, unconscious, celestial, angelic, divine; less like a sentiment than ike an instinct, less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible ut real attraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his immense tenderness or Cosette, like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed and virgin.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.33#Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already ndicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of souls; and et, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With the exception of osette, that is to say, with the exception of a childhood, Jean Valjean had ever, in the whole of his long life, known anything of that which may be loved. he passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those uccessive green growths, tender green or dark green, which can be seen in oliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty. In short, and e have insisted on it more than once, all this interior fusion, all this whole, f which the sum total was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a ather to Cosette. A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the rother, and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom there as included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adored her, and who eld that child as his light, his home, his family, his country, his aradise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.34#Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was escaping rom him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she was gliding from him, ike a cloud, like water, when he had before his eyes this crushing proof: another is the goal of her heart, another is the wish of her life; there is a earest one, I am no longer anything but her father, I no longer exist”; when he ould no longer doubt, when he said to himself: “She is going away from me!” the rief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that e had done for the purpose of ending like this! And the very idea of being othing! Then, as we have just said, a quiver of revolt ran through him from ead to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the immense eawakening of egotism, and the _I_ in this man’s abyss howled.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.35#There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. A espairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting aside nd breaking certain profound elements which, in some cases, are the very man imself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong flight of all the orces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Few among us emerge from them till like ourselves and firm in duty. When the limit of endurance is verstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted. Jean Valjean took he blotter again, and convinced himself afresh; he remained bowed and as though etrified and with staring eyes, over those four unobjectionable lines; and here arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything n this soul was crumbling away.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.36#He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of reverie, with an pparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a fearful thing when a man’s almness reaches the coldness of the statue.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.38#The unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that he had fallen ithout perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed, while he still ancied that he beheld the sun.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.39#His instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances, ertain dates, certain blushes and certain pallors on Cosette’s part, and he aid to himself: “It is he.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.1.40#The divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses ts aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not know the name, ut he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived, in the background of he implacable conjuration of his memories, the unknown prowler of the uxembourg, that wretched seeker of love adventures, that idler of romance, that diot, that coward, for it is cowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who ave beside them a father who loves them.

Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon omething solid? He probably would not have been able to tell himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.2.2#The street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidly returning ome, hardly saw him. Each one for himself in times of peril. The lamp-lighter ame as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the oor of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjean would not have appeared like a iving man to any one who had examined him in that shadow. He sat there on the ost of his door, motionless as a form of ice. There is congealment in despair. he alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all hese convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paul truck eleven, gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is man; the hour is od. The passage of the hour produced no effect on Jean Valjean; Jean Valjean id not stir. Still, at about that moment, a brusque report burst forth in the irection of the Halles, a second yet more violent followed; it was probably hat attack on the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie which we have just seen epulsed by Marius. At this double discharge, whose fury seemed augmented by the tupor of the night, Jean Valjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter hence the noise proceeded; then he fell back upon the post again, folded his rms, and his head slowly sank on his bosom again.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.2.24#Gavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he stared at t in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.2.32#Gavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who was ddressing him had no hat, and this inspired him with confidence.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.2.44#An idea flashed through Jean Valjean’s mind. Anguish does have these leams. He said to the lad:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.2.68#That said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly, luttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an scaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it, ith the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of l’Homme Armé became silent nd solitary once more; in a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him omething of the shadow and of the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the ows of black houses, and was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might ave thought that he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a ew minutes after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not he magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more bruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his way through he Rue du Chaume.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.1#Jean Valjean went into the house with Marius’ letter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.2#He groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness as an owl who rips his prey, opened and shut his door softly, listened to see whether he ould hear any noise,—made sure that, to all appearances, Cosette and Toussaint ere asleep, and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the Fumade ighter before he could evoke a spark, so greatly did his hand tremble. What he ad just done smacked of theft. At last the candle was lighted; he leaned his lbows on the table, unfolded the paper, and read.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.3#In violent emotions, one does not read, one flings to the earth, so to peak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, one crushes it, ne digs into it the nails of one’s wrath, or of one’s joy; one hastens to the nd, one leaps to the beginning; attention is at fever heat; it takes up in the ross, as it were, the essential points; it seizes on one point, and the rest isappears. In Marius’ note to Cosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.4#“I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.5#In the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; he remained or a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change of emotion which was taking lace within him, he stared at Marius’ note with a sort of intoxicated mazement, he had before his eyes that splendor, the death of a hated ndividual.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.6#He uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. The atastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who bstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man had taken himself off of his wn accord, freely, willingly. This man was going to his death, and he, Jean aljean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through no fault of his. erhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever entered into calculations. No, e is not dead yet. The letter had evidently been intended for Cosette to read n the following morning; after the two discharges that were heard between leven o’clock and midnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will ot be attacked seriously until daybreak; but that makes no difference, from the oment when “that man” is concerned in this war, he is lost; he is caught in the earing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he was about to find himself lone with Cosette once more. The rivalry would cease; the future was beginning gain. He had but to keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would never know what ad become of that man. All that there requires to be done is to let things take heir own course. This man cannot escape. If he is not already dead, it is ertain that he is about to die. What good fortune!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.7#Having said all this to himself, he became gloomy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.8#Then he went downstairs and woke up the porter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.3.9#About an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume of a ational Guard, and with his arms. The porter had easily found in the eighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment. He had a loaded gun and cartridge-box filled with cartridges.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.1#In the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.2#Gavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the Rue du haume, entered the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes, and not seeing “even a cat” here, he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the song of which e was capable. His march, far from being retarded by his singing, was ccelerated by it. He began to sow along the sleeping or terrified houses these ncendiary couplets:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.11#Gavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime. Gesture is the strong oint of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks, produced rimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a igh gale. Unfortunately, as he was alone, and as it was night, this was neither een nor even visible. Such wastes of riches do occur.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.12#All at once, he stopped short.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.14#His feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage door, what s called in painting, an _ensemble_, that is to say, a person and a thing; the hing was a hand-cart, the person was a man from Auvergene who was sleeping herein.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.15#The shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, and the Auvergnat’s head as supported against the front of the cart. His body was coiled up on this nclined plane and his feet touched the ground.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.16#Gavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, recognized a runken man. He was some corner errand-man who had drunk too much and was leeping too much.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.18#His mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.23#Gavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, had verything about him. He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled from it a crap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.24#He wrote:—

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.28#That done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring Auvergnat’s elvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, and set off in the direction f the Halles, pushing the cart before him at a hard gallop with a glorious and riumphant uproar.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.29#This was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment. avroche did not think of this. This post was occupied by the National Guards of he suburbs. The squad began to wake up, and heads were raised from camp beds. wo street lanterns broken in succession, that ditty sung at the top of the ungs. This was a great deal for those cowardly streets, which desire to go to leep at sunset, and which put the extinguisher on their candles at such an arly hour. For the last hour, that boy had been creating an uproar in that eaceable arrondissement, the uproar of a fly in a bottle. The sergeant of the anlieue lent an ear. He waited. He was a prudent man.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.34#All at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and at the very oment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes, found imself face to face with a uniform, a shako, a plume, and a gun.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.53#At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent on avroche, the cart, converted into a projectile and launched with all the atter’s might, rolled down upon him furiously, and the sergeant, struck full in he stomach, tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in he air.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.54#The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant’s shout; the hot brought on a general random discharge, after which they reloaded their eapons and began again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.55#This blind-man’s-buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed everal panes of glass.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.56#In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed, alted five or six streets distant and seated himself, panting, on the stone ost which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.57#He listened.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.58#After panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where the usillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust t forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand; n imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom has condensed French rony, and which is evidently efficacious, since it has already lasted half a entury.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:4.15.4.59#This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.1#The two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies can ame do not belong to the period in which the action of this work is laid. These wo barricades, both of them symbols, under two different aspects, of a edoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at the time of the fatal nsurrection of June, 1848, the greatest war of the streets that history has ver beheld.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.2#It sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary to iberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote, even ontrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths of its anguish, of ts discouragements and its destitutions, of its fevers, of its distresses, of ts miasmas, of its ignorances, of its darkness, that great and despairing body, he rabble, protests against, and that the populace wages battle against, the eople.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.3#Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.4#These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of night ven in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those words which are ntended to be insults—beggars, canaille, ochlocracy, populace—exhibit, alas! ather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer; rather he fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.5#For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain and without espect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond, it ften finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. Athens was an ochlocracy; the eggars were the making of Holland; the populace saved Rome more than once; and he rabble followed Jesus Christ.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.6#There is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences of he lower classes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.7#It was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, and of all hese poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable people whence prang the apostles and the martyrs, when he uttered this mysterious saying: “Fex urbis, lex orbis,”_—the dregs of the city, the law of the earth.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.8#The exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds, its violences ontrary to all sense, directed against the principles which are its life, its asterful deeds against the right, are its popular _coups d‘état_ and should be epressed. The man of probity sacrifices himself, and out of his very love for his crowd, he combats it. But how excusable he feels it even while holding out gainst it! How he venerates it even while resisting it! This is one of those are moments when, while doing that which it is one’s duty to do, one feels omething which disconcerts one, and which would dissuade one from proceeding urther; one persists, it is necessary, but conscience, though satisfied, is ad, and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.9#June, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, and almost mpossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. All the words which e have just uttered, must be discarded, when it becomes a question of this xtraordinary revolt, in which one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming its ights. It was necessary to combat it, and this was a duty, for it attacked the epublic. But what was June, 1848, at bottom? A revolt of the people against tself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.10#Where the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; may we, hen, be permitted to arrest the reader’s attention for a moment on the two bsolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which haracterized this insurrection.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.11#One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other defended he approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom these two fearful asterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of une, will never forget them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.12#The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high, and even hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg, that is to ay, three streets, from angle to angle; ravined, jagged, cut up, divided, renelated, with an immense rent, buttressed with piles that were bastions in hemselves throwing out capes here and there, powerfully backed up by two great romontories of houses of the faubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike t the end of the formidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen arricades were ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets ehind this principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one felt the agonizing uffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that point of extremity hen a distress may become a catastrophe. Of what was that barricade made? Of he ruins of three six-story houses demolished expressly, said some. Of the rodigy of all wraths, said others. It wore the lamentable aspect of all onstructions of hatred, ruin. It might be asked: Who built this? It might also e said: Who destroyed this? It was the improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! ake this door! this grating! this penthouse! this chimney-piece! this broken razier! this cracked pot! Give all! cast away all! Push this roll, dig, ismantle, overturn, ruin everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, he block of stone, the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken ane, the unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and the alediction. It was grand and it was petty. It was the abyss parodied on the ublic place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip of ruined wall and he broken bowl,—threatening fraternization of every sort of rubbish. Sisyphus ad thrown his rock there and Job his potsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the cropolis of the barefooted. Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; n immense dray was spread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, nd seemed a scar on that tumultuous façade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main orce, to the very summit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of avagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror, resented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the ir. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt, figured to the mind an Ossa n Pelion of all revolutions; ’93 on ’89, the 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of ugust, the 18th of Brumaire on the 11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 848 on 1830. The situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy o figure on the very spot whence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean ade dikes, it is thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped pon this shapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub etrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there ad been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. Was it a hicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to have onstructed it with blows of its wings. There was something of the cesspool in hat redoubt and something Olympian in that confusion. One there beheld in a ell-mell full of despair, the rafters of roofs, bits of garret windows with heir figured paper, window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins waiting the cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howling opsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very refuse of he mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and nothingness. One would ave said that it was the tatters of a people, rags of wood, of iron, of bronze, f stone, and that the Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust it there at its door, ith a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks esembling headsman’s blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with rackets having the form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the ubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old ortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine converted everything nto a weapon; everything that civil war could throw at the head of society roceeded thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm; the carbines which efended this redoubt, among which there were some blunderbusses, sent bits of arthenware bones, coat-buttons, even the casters from night-stands, dangerous rojectiles on account of the brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to he clouds an inexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, t was covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads rowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, of sabres, of udgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flag flapped in the wind; houts of command, songs of attack, the roll of drums, the sobs of women and ursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there. It was huge nd living, and, like the back of an electric beast, there proceeded from it ittle flashes of lightning. The spirit of revolution covered with its cloud his summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of od; a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. It was a eap of filth and it was Sinai.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.13#As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the evolution—what? The revolution. It—that barricade, chance, hazard, disorder, error, misunderstanding, the unknown—had facing it the Constituent Assembly, he sovereignty of the people, universal suffrage, the nation, the republic; and t was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to the Marseillaise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.14#Immense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.15#The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourg houldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg. he vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the frican generals dashed itself. Its caverns, its excrescences, its warts, its ibbosities, grimaced, so to speak, and grinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille anished in shapelessness; the bombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in aking holes in it; what was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, ccustomed to the fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that pecies of redoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain by ts enormous size.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.16#A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple which ebouches on the boulevard near the Château-d’Eau, if one thrust one’s head odily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop, one erceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street which mounts the lopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise, a strange wall eaching to the second story of the house fronts, a sort of hyphen between the ouses on the right and the houses on the left, as though the street had folded ack on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly. This wall as built of paving-stones. It was straight, correct, cold, perpendicular, evelled with the square, laid out by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of ourse, but, as in the case of certain Roman walls, without interfering with its igid architecture. The entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. rom distance to distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost nvisible loopholes which resembled black threads. These loopholes were eparated from each other by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the ye could reach. All windows and doors were closed. In the background rose this arrier, which made a blind thoroughfare of the street, a motionless and ranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible; not a cry, not a sound, ot a breath. A sepulchre.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.17#The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.18#It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.19#As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it was mpossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before this ysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated, rectilinear, ymmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One felt that the chief f this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre. One looked at it and spoke ow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.20#From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of the eople, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp whistle was eard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped the bullet, ometimes a biscaïen was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter, in the nterstice between two blocks of stone, or in the plaster of a wall. For the men n the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two cast-iron engths of gas-pipe, plugged up at one end with tow and fire-clay. There was no aste of useless powder. Nearly every shot told. There were corpses here and here, and pools of blood on the pavement. I remember a white butterfly which ent and came in the street. Summer does not abdicate.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.21#In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes-cochères were ncumbered with wounded.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.22#One felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see, and one nderstood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.23#Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at he entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers of the attacking column, ravely and thoughtfully, watched this dismal redoubt, this immobility, this assivity, whence sprang death. Some crawled flat on their faces as far as the rest of the curve of the bridge, taking care that their shakos did not project eyond it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.24#The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a shudder.—“How hat is built!” he said to a Representative. “Not one paving-stone projects eyond its neighbor. It is made of porcelain.”—At that moment, a bullet broke he cross on his breast, and he fell.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.25#“The cowards!” people said. “Let them show themselves. Let us see them! hey dare not! They are hiding!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.26#The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men, attacked y ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, they did as at Zaatcha, s at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they came over the roofs, the arricade was taken. Not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight, all were illed there with the exception of the leader, Barthélemy, of whom we shall peak presently.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.27#The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade of he Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubts was the ifference between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed a maw; the other mask.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.28#Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was composed f a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first barricade the dragon, and ehind the second the sphinx.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.29#These two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the one, Cournet, he other, Barthélemy. Cournet made the Saint-Antoine barricade; Barthélemy the arricade of the Temple. Each was the image of the man who had built it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.30#Cournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face, a rushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible eye. Intrepid, nergetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men, the most formidable of ombatants. War, strife, conflict, were the very air he breathed and put him in good humor. He had been an officer in the navy, and, from his gestures and his oice, one divined that he sprang from the ocean, and that he came from the empest; he carried the hurricane on into battle. With the exception of the enius, there was in Cournet something of Danton, as, with the exception of the ivinity, there was in Danton something of Hercules.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.31#Barthélemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic street rchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, lay in wait for him, and illed him, and at seventeen was sent to the galleys. He came out and made this arricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.1.32#Later on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, Barthélemy lew Cournet. It was a funereal duel. Some time afterwards, caught in the earing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part, a atastrophe in which French justice sees extenuating circumstances, and in which nglish justice sees only death, Barthélemy was hanged. The sombre social onstruction is so made that, thanks to material destitution, thanks to moral bscurity, that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence, certainly firm, ossibly great, began in France with the galleys, and ended in England with the allows. Barthélemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.head#CHAPTER II—WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT ONVERSE
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.1#Sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, and une, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. So the barricade of he Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, and an embryo compared to the two olossal barricades which we have just sketched; but it was formidable for that poch.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.2#The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer looked after nything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had been not only epaired, but augmented. They had raised it two feet. Bars of iron planted in he pavement resembled lances in rest. All sorts of rubbish brought and added rom all directions complicated the external confusion. The redoubt had been leverly made over, into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.3#The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like the all of a citadel had been reconstructed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.4#The barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, the itchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the wounded completed, he powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up, ullets run, cartridges manufactured, lint scraped, the fallen weapons e-distributed, the interior of the redoubt cleaned, the rubbish swept up, orpses removed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.5#They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondétour lane, of which they were till the masters. The pavement was red for a long time at that spot. Among the ead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs. Enjolras had their niforms laid aside.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.6#Enjolras had advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras was a ommand. Still, only three or four took advantage of it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.7#Feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the wall hich faced the tavern:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.8#LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.9#These four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, could be till read on the wall in 1848.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.10#The three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish efinitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.11#They had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.12#The greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still. On litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen, which had been onverted into an ambulance, there were five men gravely wounded, two of whom ere municipal guardsmen. The municipal guardsmen were attended to first.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.13#In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth and avert bound to his post.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.14#“This is the hall of the dead,” said Enjolras.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.15#In the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end, the ortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, a sort of vast, ague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf lying prone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.16#The pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, was still ufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.17#Enjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing what he aid, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody coat of the old an’s.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.18#No repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. The fifty en in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of the ine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there. At a given oment, every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of _la Méduse_. They were bliged to resign themselves to hunger. They had then reached the first hours of hat Spartan day of the 6th of June when, in the barricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, urrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread, replied to all combatants rying: “Something to eat!” with: “Why? It is three o’clock; at four we shall be ead.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.19#As they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. He nterdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.20#They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed. njolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up again aid:—“It’s the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business as a rocer.”—“It must be real wine,” observed Bossuet. “It’s lucky that Grantaire is sleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving hose bottles.”—Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs, placed his veto on the ifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might touch them, he had them placed nder the table on which Father Mabeuf was lying.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.21#About two o’clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. There ere still thirty-seven of them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.22#The day began to dawn. The torch, which had been replaced in its cavity in he pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior of the barricade, that pecies of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street, was bathed in shadows, nd resembled, athwart the vague, twilight horror, the deck of a disabled ship. he combatants, as they went and came, moved about there like black forms. Above hat terrible nesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly utlined; at the very top, the chimneys stood palely out. The sky was of that harming, undecided hue, which may be white and may be blue. Birds flew about in t with cries of joy. The lofty house which formed the back of the barricade, eing turned to the East, had upon its roof a rosy reflection. The morning reeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man at the third-story indow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.23#“I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished,” said Courfeyrac to euilly. “That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. It had the appearance of eing afraid. The light of torches resembles the wisdom of cowards; it gives a ad light because it trembles.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.24#Dawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.

The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse, plus the cat, is the proof f creation revised and corrected.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.27#Combeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of the dead, f Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Cabuc, and of Enjolras’ ad severity. He said:—
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.28#“Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell, harlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it was too late. ur hearts quiver so, and human life is such a mystery that, even in the case of civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, if there be such a thing, the emorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human ace.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.29#And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment ater, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire’s verses, Combeferre as comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux with Cournand, Cournand with elille, pointing out the passages translated by Malfilâtre, particularly the rodigies of Cæsar’s death; and at that word, Cæsar, the conversation reverted o Brutus.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.2.30#“Cæsar,” said Combeferre, “fell justly. Cicero was severe towards Cæsar, nd he was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoïlus insults Homer, when ævius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière, when Pope insults Shakspeare, hen Frederic insults Voltaire, it is an old law of envy and hatred which is eing carried out; genius attracts insult, great men are always more or less arked at. But Zoïlus and Cicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter n thought, just as Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame hat last justice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. Cæsar, the violator of he Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the dignities which manated from the people, not rising at the entrance of the senate, committed he acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, _regia ac pene tyrannica_. He was a reat man; so much the worse, or so much the better; the lesson is but the more xalted. His twenty-three wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of esus Christ. Cæsar is stabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. One eels the God through the greater outrage.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.3.2#The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in which they ad repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain n advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with a smile. They had no more oubt as to their success than as to their cause. Moreover, succor was, vidently, on the way to them. They reckoned on it. With that facility of riumphant prophecy which is one of the sources of strength in the French ombatant, they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases. At ix o’clock in the morning a regiment “which had been labored with,” would turn; t noon, the insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.4.20#“Come,” said he, “you must have a little pity. Do you know what the uestion is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there women or are here not? Are there children or are there not? Are there mothers, yes or no, ho rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them? et that man of you who has never beheld a nurse’s breast raise his hand. Ah! ou want to get yourselves killed, so do I—I, who am speaking to you; but I do ot want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their arms around me. Die, if ou will, but don’t make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink of ccomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not admit of xtension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide is murder. Think of he little blond heads; think of the white locks. Listen, Enjolras has just told e that he saw at the corner of the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in poor window, on the fifth floor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the ead of an old woman, who had the air of having spent the night in watching. erhaps she is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make aste, to say to his mother: ‘Here I am, mother!’ Let him feel at ease, the task ere will be performed all the same. When one supports one’s relatives by one’s oil, one has not the right to sacrifice one’s self. That is deserting one’s amily. And those who have daughters! what are you thinking of? You get ourselves killed, you are dead, that is well. And tomorrow? Young girls without read—that is a terrible thing. Man begs, woman sells. Ah! those charming and racious beings, so gracious and so sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill he house with purity, who sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who rove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that eanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures who are your lessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! What do you ant me to say to you? There is a market for human flesh; and it is not with our shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that you will prevent them from ntering it! Think of the street, think of the pavement covered with passers-by, hink of the shops past which women go and come with necks all bare, and through he mire. These women, too, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you ho have them. Misery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare—that is what those eautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, gentleness and oveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May, will come to. Ah! you have ot yourselves killed! You are no longer on hand! That is well; you have wished o release the people from Royalty, and you deliver over your daughters to the olice. Friends, have a care, have mercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in he habit of bestowing much thought on them. We trust to the women not having eceived a man’s education, we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, e prevent their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them from oing to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your bodies? Let us see, hose who have families must be tractable, and shake hands with us and take hemselves off, and leave us here alone to attend to this affair. I know well hat courage is required to leave, that it is hard; but the harder it is, the ore meritorious. You say: ‘I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much the orse, I shall remain there.’ So much the worse is easily said. My friends, here is a morrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will; and hat sufferings! See, here is a pretty, healthy child, with cheeks like an pple, who babbles, prattles, chatters, who laughs, who smells sweet beneath our kiss,—and do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I have seen ne, a very small creature, no taller than that. His father was dead. Poor eople had taken him in out of charity, but they had bread only for themselves. he child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry. You could see him pproach the stove, in which there was never any fire, and whose pipe, you know, as of mastic and yellow clay. His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, his imbs flaccid, his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke to him, he did ot answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, where I saw him. I as house-surgeon in that hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, athers whose happiness it is to stroll on Sundays holding their child’s tiny and in their robust hand, let each one of those fathers imagine that this child s his own. That poor brat, I remember, and I seem to see him now, when he lay ude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves eneath the grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found in his stomach. There ere ashes in his teeth. Come, let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take ounsel with our heart. Statistics show that the mortality among abandoned hildren is fifty-five per cent. I repeat, it is a question of women, it oncerns mothers, it concerns young girls, it concerns little children. Who is alking to you of yourselves? We know well what you are; we know well that you re all brave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and he glory of giving your life for the great cause; we know well that you feel ourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently, and that each one of you lings to his share in the triumph. Very well. But you are not alone in this orld. There are other beings of whom you must think. You must not be goists.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.5.1#The situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place, had as esult and culminating point Enjolras’ supreme melancholy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.5.2#Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he was ncomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so; he had too much of aint-Just about him, and not enough of Anacharsis Cloots; still, his mind, in he society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended by undergoing a certain olarization from Combeferre’s ideas; for some time past, he had been gradually merging from the narrow form of dogma, and had allowed himself to incline to he broadening influence of progress, and he had come to accept, as a definitive nd magnificent evolution, the transformation of the great French Republic, into he immense human republic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a iolent situation being given, he wished to be violent; on that point, he never aried; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up n the words: “Eighty-three.” Enjolras was standing erect on the staircase of aving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock of his gun. He was engaged in hought; he quivered, as at the passage of prophetic breaths; places where death s have these effects of tripods. A sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes, hich were filled with an inward look. All at once he threw back his head, his lond locks fell back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of tars, they were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, and njolras cried:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.5.3#“Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of cities nundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations sisters, men ust, old men blessing children, the past loving the present, thinkers entirely t liberty, believers on terms of full equality, for religion heaven, God the irect priest, human conscience become an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity f the workshop and the school, for sole penalty and recompense fame, work for ll, right for all, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy others! To conquer matter is the first step; to realize the ideal is the econd. Reflect on what progress has already accomplished. Formerly, the first uman races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes, breathing on he waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who was the monster of he air, and who flew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger; earful beasts which were above man. Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, onsecrated by intelligence, and finally conquered these monsters. We have anquished the hydra, and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of anquishing the griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On he day when this Promethean task shall be accomplished, and when man shall have efinitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimæra of antiquity, the hydra, the ragon and the griffin, he will be the master of water, fire, and of air, and he ill be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly ere to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens, whither are we going? To science ade government, to the force of things become the sole public force, to the atural law, having in itself its sanction and its penalty and promulgating tself by evidence, to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are dvancing to the union of peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more ictions; no more parasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal. ivilization will hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and, later on, at he centre of continents, in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Something imilar has already been seen. The amphictyons had two sittings a year, one at elphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylæ, the place of heroes. urope will have her amphictyons; the globe will have its amphictyons. France ears this sublime future in her breast. This is the gestation of the nineteenth entury. That which Greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by France. isten to me, you, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. es, you clearly behold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither father or mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right for your ather. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here. Citizens, hatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, it s a revolution that we are about to create. As conflagrations light up a whole ity, so revolutions illuminate the whole human race. And what is the revolution hat we shall cause? I have just told you, the Revolution of the True. From a olitical point of view, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man ver himself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty. Where wo or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. But in that ssociation there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes a certain quantity f itself, for the purpose of forming the common right. This quantity is the ame for all of us. This identity of concession which each makes to all, is alled Equality. Common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming n the right of each. This protection of all over each is called Fraternity. The oint of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society. his intersection being a junction, this point is a knot. Hence what is called he social bond. Some say social contract; which is the same thing, the word ontract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond. Let us come to an nderstanding about equality; for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the ase. Equality, citizens, is not wholly a surface vegetation, a society of great lades of grass and tiny oaks; a proximity of jealousies which render each other ull and void; legally speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same pportunity; politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight; eligiously, it is all consciences possessed of the same right. Equality has an rgan: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet, that is here the beginning must be made. The primary school imposed on all, the econdary school offered to all, that is the law. From an identical school, an dentical society will spring. Yes, instruction! light! light! everything comes rom light, and to it everything returns. Citizens, the nineteenth century is reat, but the twentieth century will be happy. Then, there will be nothing more ike the history of old, we shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, n invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an interruption f civilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a birth in hereditary yrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a dismemberment because of the ailure of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting face to face, like two ucks in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we shall no longer have to ear famine, farming out, prostitution arising from distress, misery from the ailure of work and the scaffold and the sword, and battles and the ruffianism f chance in the forest of events. One might almost say: There will be no more vents. We shall be happy. The human race will accomplish its law, as the errestrial globe accomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between he soul and the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, as the planet round the light. Friends, the present hour in which I am addressing you, is a loomy hour; but these are terrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a oll. Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it on his barrier. Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from the heights of acrifice? Oh my brothers, this is the point of junction, of those who think and f those who suffer; this barricade is not made of paving-stones, nor of joists, or of bits of iron; it is made of two heaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of oes. Here misery meets the ideal. The day embraces the night, and says to it: I am about to die, and thou shalt be born again with me.’ From the embrace of ll desolations faith leaps forth.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.2#Let the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it, verything was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. Marius, let us nsist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, dark wings which are pread over those in the death agony. He felt that he had entered the tomb, it eemed to him that he was already on the other side of the wall, and he no onger beheld the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.3#How did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he come here to do? Marius did not address all these questions to himself. Besides, ince our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops others as well as urselves, it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to ie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.4#Only, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.5#However, M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at him, and had ot even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice to say: “I know im.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.6#As far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent was omforting, and, if such a word can be used for such impressions, we should say hat it pleased him. He had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing hat enigmatical man, who was, in his eyes, both equivocal and imposing. oreover, it had been a long time since he had seen him; and this still further ugmented the impossibility for Marius’ timid and reserved nature.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.7#The five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondétour lane; they bore perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. One of them wept as he ook his leave. Before setting out, they embraced those who remained.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.9#He entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged in editation.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.16#“I am uncomfortable against this post,” replied Javert. “You are not ender to have left me to pass the night here. Bind me as you please, but you urely might lay me out on a table like that other man.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.18#There was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table at the end of he room, on which they had been running bullets and making cartridges. All the artridges having been made, and all the powder used, this table was free.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.21#By way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his neck, hey added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at escape mpossible, that sort of bond which is called in prisons a martingale, which, tarting at the neck, forks on the stomach, and meets the hands, after passing etween the legs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.6.22#While they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold was urveying him with singular attention. The shadow cast by this man made Javert urn his head. He raised his eyes, and recognized Jean Valjean. He did not even tart, but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark: “It is erfectly simple.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.head#CHAPTER VII—THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.1#The daylight was increasing rapidly. Not a window was opened, not a door tood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue de la hanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by the troops, as we have tated, it seemed to be free, and presented itself to passers-by with a sinister ranquillity. The Rue Saint-Denis was as dumb as the avenue of Sphinxes at hebes. Not a living being in the crossroads, which gleamed white in the light f the sun. Nothing is so mournful as this light in deserted streets. Nothing as to be seen, but there was something to be heard. A mysterious movement was oing on at a certain distance. It was evident that the critical moment was pproaching. As on the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; but this ime all had come.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.2#The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack. Since he departure of the five, they had increased its height still further.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.3#On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the Halles, njolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a serious decision. He had he small gut of the Mondétour lane, which had been left open up to that time, arricaded. For this purpose, they tore up the pavement for the length of everal houses more. In this manner, the barricade, walled on three streets, in ront on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de la etite Truanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondétour, was really almost mpregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. It had three ronts, but no exit.—“A fortress but a rat hole too,” said Courfeyrac with a augh.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.4#Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones “torn up in excess,” said Bossuet, iled up near the door of the wine-shop.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.5#The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must needs ome, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.6#An allowance of brandy was doled out to each.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.7#Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Each man elects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow and crowd ach other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones. Here is a corner of he wall which is in the way, it is removed; here is a redan which may afford rotection, they take shelter behind it. Left-handed men are precious; they take he places that are inconvenient to the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting osture. They wish to be at ease to kill, and to die comfortably. In the sad war f June, 1848, an insurgent who was a formidable marksman, and who was firing rom the top of a terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair brought there for is use; a charge of grape-shot found him out there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.8#As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action, ll disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from one another; there re no more coteries; no more asides, there is no more holding aloof; everything n their spirits converges in, and changes into, a waiting for the assailants. A arricade before the arrival of danger is chaos; in danger, it is discipline tself. Peril produces order.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.9#As soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, and had placed imself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself, all the rest eld their peace. A series of faint, sharp noises resounded confusedly along the all of paving-stones. It was the men cocking their guns.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.10#Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; the xcess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope, but they had espair, despair,—the last weapon, which sometimes gives victory; Virgil has aid so. Supreme resources spring from extreme resolutions. To embark in death s sometimes the means of escaping a shipwreck; and the lid of the coffin ecomes a plank of safety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.11#As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, we might lmost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted up and visible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.12#They had not long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu uarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. A clashing of hains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brass skipping along the avement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced that some sinister construction of ron was approaching. There arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old treets, pierced and built for the fertile circulation of interests and ideas, nd which are not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.13#The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street ecame ferocious.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.14#A cannon made its appearance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.15#Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; the ore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, four were at the heels; others followed with the caisson. They could see the smoke of the urning lint-stock.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.16#“Fire!” shouted Enjolras.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.17#The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche of smoke overed and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds, the cloud ispersed, and the cannon and men reappeared; the gun-crew had just finished olling it slowly, correctly, without haste, into position facing the barricade. ot one of them had been struck. Then the captain of the piece, bearing down pon the breech in order to raise the muzzle, began to point the cannon with the ravity of an astronomer levelling a telescope.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.18#“Bravo for the cannoneers!” cried Bossuet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.19#And the whole barricade clapped their hands.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.20#A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street, astride f the gutter, the piece was ready for action. A formidable pair of jaws yawned n the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.21#“Come, merrily now!” ejaculated Courfeyrac. “That’s the brutal part of it. fter the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The army is reaching out ts big paw to us. The barricade is going to be severely shaken up. The usillade tries, the cannon takes.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.22#“It is a piece of eight, new model, brass,” added Combeferre. “Those ieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tin to one undred of brass is exceeded. The excess of tin renders them too tender. Then it omes to pass that they have caves and chambers when looked at from the vent ole. In order to obviate this danger, and to render it possible to force the harge, it may become necessary to return to the process of the fourteenth entury, hooping, and to encircle the piece on the outside with a series of nwelded steel bands, from the breech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they emedy this defect as best they may; they manage to discover where the holes are ocated in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there is a better ethod, with Gribeauval’s movable star.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.23#“In the sixteenth century,” remarked Bossuet, “they used to rifle annon.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.24#“Yes,” replied Combeferre, “that augments the projectile force, but iminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, the trajectory s not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola is exaggerated, the line of he projectile is no longer sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its striking ntervening objects, which is, nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the mportance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and the recipitation of the discharge. This defect of the tension of the curve of the rojectile in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the mallness of the charge; small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by he ballistic necessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the un-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it desires; orce is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only travels six hundred leagues an our; light travels seventy thousand leagues a second. Such is the superiority f Jesus Christ over Napoleon.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.25#“Reload your guns,” said Enjolras.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.26#How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the annon-balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. While the nsurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men were loading the annon.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.32#Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the annon-ball.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.7.33#The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there was an mnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. On seeing this, he barricade burst into a laugh.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.1#They flocked round Gavroche. But he had no time to tell anything. Marius rew him aside with a shudder.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.2#“What are you doing here?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.4#And he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. His eyes grew arger with the proud light within them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.5#It was with an accent of severity that Marius continued:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.7#Gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter. In is haste to return to the barricade, he had got rid of it rather than delivered t. He was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confided it rather ightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to make out. It is true hat the man was bareheaded, but that was not sufficient. In short, he had been dministering to himself little inward remonstrances and he feared Marius’ eproaches. In order to extricate himself from the predicament, he took the implest course; he lied abominably.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.8#“Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep. She ill have the letter when she wakes up.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.9#Marius had had two objects in sending that letter: to bid farewell to osette and to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself with the half of is desire.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.10#The despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent in the arricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. He pointed out M. auchelevent to Gavroche.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.8.17#Gavroche warned “his comrades” as he called them, that the barricade was locked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of the line hose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was on the watch on the ide of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, the municipal guard occupied the ue des Prêcheurs.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.1#At that moment, Cosette awoke.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.2#Her chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window, facing he East on the back court-yard of the house.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.3#Cosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had not been there n the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her chamber when oussaint had said:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.4#“It appears that there is a row.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.5#Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweet dreams, hich possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white. Some one, ho was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. She awoke with the sun in her yes, which, at first, produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her ream. Her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette elt herself thoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hours reviously, passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not ear of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope, with all her might, without nowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart. It was three days since she had een Marius. But she said to herself that he must have received her letter, that e knew where she was, and that he was so clever that he would find means of eaching her.—And that certainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.—It was road daylight, but the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it as very early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive arius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.6#She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that, consequently, hat was sufficient and that Marius would come. No objection was valid. All this as certain. It was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days. arius absent three days, this was horrible on the part of the good God. Now, his cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with. Marius was about to rrive, and he would bring good news. Youth is made thus; it quickly dries its yes; it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it. Youth is the smile of the uture in the presence of an unknown quantity, which is itself. It is natural to t to be happy. It seems as though its respiration were made of hope.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.7#Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her on the ubject of this absence which was to last only one day, and what explanation of t he had given her. Every one has noticed with what nimbleness a coin which one as dropped on the ground rolls away and hides, and with what art it renders tself undiscoverable. There are thoughts which play us the same trick; they estle away in a corner of our brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it s impossible to lay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the seless little effort made by her memory. She told herself, that it was very aughty and very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by arius.

Woman in the bud is acred. That innocent bud which opens, that adorable half-nudity which is afraid f itself, that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper, that throat which eils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye, that chemise which akes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture r a passing vehicle, those cords tied, those clasps fastened, those laces rawn, those tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite affright n every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for larm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming as the clouds of dawn,—it s not fitting that all this should be narrated, and it is too much to have even alled attention to it.

The young girl is only the flash of a dream, and is not et a statue. Her bed-chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The ndiscreet touch of a glance brutalizes this vague penumbra.

But no view of he outside was to be had. The back court was surrounded by tolerably high alls, and the outlook was only on several gardens. Cosette pronounced these ardens hideous: for the first time in her life, she found flowers ugly. The mallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She ecided to gaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come from hat quarter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.15#All at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness of soul; ut hopes cut in twain by dejection—that was her case. She had a confused onsciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in the air, in fact. She old herself that she was not sure of anything, that to withdraw herself from ight was to be lost; and the idea that Marius could return to her from heaven ppeared to her no longer charming but mournful.

Toussaint had not isen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her father was asleep. She must have uffered much, and she must have still been suffering greatly, for she said to erself, that her father had been unkind; but she counted on Marius. The eclipse f such a light was decidedly impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks n the distance, and she said: “It is odd that people should be opening and hutting their carriage gates so early.” They were the reports of the cannon attering the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.10.18#A few feet below Cosette’s window, in the ancient and perfectly black ornice of the wall, there was a martin’s nest; the curve of this nest formed a ittle projection beyond the cornice, so that from above it was possible to look nto this little paradise. The mother was there, spreading her wings like a fan ver her brood; the father fluttered about, flew away, then came back, bearing n his beak food and kisses. The dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great aw, “Multiply,” lay there smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded n the glory of the morning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her soul bsorbed in chimæras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn without, bent ver mechanically, and almost without daring to avow to herself that she was hinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze at these birds, at this amily, at that male and female, that mother and her little ones, with the rofound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.11.1#The assailants’ fire continued. Musketry and grape-shot alternated, but ithout committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of the orinthe façade suffered; the window on the first floor, and the attic window in he roof, riddled with buckshot and biscaïens, were slowly losing their shape. he combatants who had been posted there had been obliged to withdraw. However, his is according to the tactics of barricades; to fire for a long while, in rder to exhaust the insurgents’ ammunition, if they commit the mistake of eplying. When it is perceived, from the slackening of their fire, that they ave no more powder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into his trap; the barricade did not reply.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.11.6#One gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball.

The nsurgents suddenly perceived a helmet glittering in the sun on a neighboring oof. A fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney, and seemed to be cting as sentinel. His glance fell directly down into the barricade.

Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded his gun, took aim at the newcomer nd sent the officer’s casque to join the soldier’s. The officer did not ersist, and retired speedily. This time the warning was understood. No one made is appearance thereafter on that roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade as abandoned.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.4#Those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch know hat the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant against insurrections. It as particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of June, 1832. A certain good ram-shop keeper of Pantin des Vertus or la Cunette, whose “establishment” had een closed by the riots, became leonine at the sight of his deserted ance-hall, and got himself killed to preserve the order represented by a ea-garden. In that bourgeois and heroic time, in the presence of ideas which ad their knights, interests had their paladins. The prosiness of the riginators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement. The diminution f a pile of crowns made bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood yrically for the counting-house; and they defended the shop, that immense iminutive of the fatherland, with Lacedæmonian enthusiasm.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.5#At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was not xtremely serious. It was social elements entering into strife, while awaiting he day when they should enter into equilibrium.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.7#The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such or such a olonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went into action through nspiration; such and such National Guardsmen fought, “for an idea,” and on heir own account. At critical moments, on “days” they took counsel less of heir leaders than of their instincts. There existed in the army of order, eritable guerilleros, some of the sword, like Fannicot, others of the pen, like enri Fonfrède.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.8#Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather by an ggregation of interests than by a group of principles, was or thought itself, n peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, constituting himself a centre, efended it, succored it, and protected it with his own head; and the first omer took it upon himself to save society.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.9#Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the National Guard ould constitute itself on its own authority a private council of war, and judge nd execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. It was an improvisation of his sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. Fierce Lynch law, with which no one arty had any right to reproach the rest, for it has been applied by the epublic in America, as well as by the monarchy in Europe. This Lynch law was omplicated with mistakes. On one day of rioting, a young poet, named Paul Aimé arnier, was pursued in the Place Royale, with a bayonet at his loins, and only scaped by taking refuge under the porte-cochère of No. 6. They houted:—“There’s another of those Saint-Simonians!” and they wanted to kill im. Now, he had under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de aint-Simon. A National Guard had read the words _Saint-Simon_ on the book, and ad shouted: “Death!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.10#On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from the uburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itself ecimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good pleasure. his fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at the judicial investigation pened in consequence of the insurrection of 1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold and mpatient bourgeois, a sort of condottiere of the order of those whom we have ust characterized, a fanatical and intractable governmentalist, could not esist the temptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing the arricade alone and unaided, that is to say, with his company. Exasperated by he successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the lack flag, he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps, who were olding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had rrived, and who were allowing “the insurrection to fry in its own fat,” to use he celebrated expression of one of them. For his part, he thought the barricade ipe, and as that which is ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.11#He commanded men as resolute as himself, “raging fellows,” as a witness aid. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, was the irst of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. At the moment when hey were least expecting it, the captain launched his men against the arricade. This movement, executed with more good will than strategy, cost the annicot company dear. Before it had traversed two thirds of the street it was eceived by a general discharge from the barricade. Four, the most audacious, ho were running on in front, were mown down point-blank at the very foot of the edoubt, and this courageous throng of National Guards, very brave men but acking in military tenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation, eaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gave the nsurgents time to re-load their weapons, and a second and very destructive ischarge struck the company before it could regain the corner of the street, ts shelter. A moment more, and it was caught between two fires, and it received he volley from the battery piece which, not having received the order, had not iscontinued its firing.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.12.14#Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was. nsurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons. Insurrection, which s speedily exhausted, has only a certain number of shots to fire and a certain umber of combatants to expend. An empty cartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be eplaced. As repression has the army, it does not count its men, and, as it has incennes, it does not count its shots. Repression has as many regiments as the arricade has men, and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. hus they are struggles of one against a hundred, which always end in crushing he barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly, flings into the balance ts flaming archangel’s sword. This does happen sometimes. Then everything ises, the pavements begin to seethe, popular redoubts abound. Paris quivers upremely, the _quid divinum_ is given forth, a 10th of August is in the air, a 9th of July is in the air, a wonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force raws back, and the army, that lion, sees before it, erect and tranquil, that rophet, France.

The obstinacy of the larm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades were begun in the ue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front of the Porte Saint-Martin, young man, armed with a rifle, attacked alone a squadron of cavalry. In plain ight, on the open boulevard, he placed one knee on the ground, shouldered his eapon, fired, killed the commander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: There’s another who will do us no more harm.”

Many posts were attacked. t the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poirée, a very lively and utterly unexpected usillade welcomed a regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal eneral Cavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces f pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a bad ign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon’s old ieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet’s saying at Saragossa: “We are ost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads.”

The troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been ired; at the same time, manœuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the oulevards. This repression was not effected without some commotion, and without hat tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people. his was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the usketry.

At the same time that the wo guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue de la Chanvrerie, two ther cannons, trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis, the other from the Rue ubry-le-Boucher, were riddling the Saint-Merry barricade.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.15.12#It will be remembered that Fannicot’s company had left behind it a trail f bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement, through he whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for Gavroche meant a provision f cartridges for the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.15.13#The smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud which as fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can imagine this moke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses. It rose radually and was incessantly renewed; hence a twilight which made even the road daylight turn pale. The combatants could hardly see each other from one nd of the street to the other, short as it was.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.15.14#This obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by the ommanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, was useful to avroche.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.15.20#By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade ecame transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on the outlook ehind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of the banlieue massed at he corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each other something moving hrough the smoke.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.15.21#At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying near a tone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.15.32#It was a charming and terrible sight. Gavroche, though shot at, was easing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. It was the parrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge he retorted with a couplet. hey aimed at him constantly, and always missed him. The National Guardsmen and he soldiers laughed as they took aim at him. He lay down, sprang to his feet, id in the corner of a doorway, then made a bound, disappeared, reappeared, campered away, returned, replied to the grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, nd, all the while, went on pillaging the cartouches, emptying the artridge-boxes, and filling his basket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety, ollowed him with their eyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a hild, he was not a man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called he invulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was more imble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and seek with death; every ime that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached, the urchin administered o it a fillip.

Gavroche was seen to stagger, hen he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave vent to a cry; but there was omething of Antæus in that pygmy; for the gamin to touch the pavement is the ame as for the giant to touch the earth; Gavroche had fallen only to rise gain; he remained in a sitting posture, a long thread of blood streaked his ace, he raised both arms in the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot ad come, and began to sing:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.1#At that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,—for the gaze of the rama must be everywhere present,—two children were holding each other by the and. One might have been seven years old, the other five. The rain having oaked them, they were walking along the paths on the sunny side; the elder was eading the younger; they were pale and ragged; they had the air of wild birds. he smaller of them said: “I am very hungry.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.2#The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading his brother ith his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.3#They were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had been losed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. The troops who ad been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of combat.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.4#How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some uard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at the Barrière ’Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l’Observatoire, or in the neighboring carrefour, ominated by the pediment on which could be read: _Invenerunt parvulum pannis nvolutum_, some mountebank’s booth from which they had fled; perhaps they had, n the preceding evening, escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the our of closing, and had passed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes here people read the papers? The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed ree. To be astray and to seem free is to be lost. These poor little creatures ere, in fact, lost.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.5#These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to some rouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the Thénardiers, leased out o Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and now leaves fallen from all these ootless branches, and swept over the ground by the wind. Their clothing, which ad been clean in Magnon’s day, and which had served her as a prospectus with M. illenormand, had been converted into rags.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.6#Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as “Abandoned children,” hom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again on the pavements of aris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.7#It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these iserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents had aught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poor little things o not enter public gardens; still, people should reflect that, as children, hey have a right to flowers.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.8#These children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were there ontrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and there they emained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight is supposed to ontinue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the inspectors, moved by the ublic anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside, no longer lanced into the garden, and had not seen the two delinquents.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.9#It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. But in une, showers do not count for much. An hour after a storm, it can hardly be een that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, in summer, is as quickly ried as the cheek of a child. At that period of the solstice, the light of full oonday is, so to speak, poignant. It takes everything. It applies itself to the arth, and superposes itself with a sort of suction. One would say that the sun as thirsty. A shower is but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk p. In the morning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything is owdered over.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.10#Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped y the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens and meadows, having ater at their roots, and sun in their flowers, become perfuming-pans of ncense, and smoke with all their odors at once. Everything smiles, sings and ffers itself. One feels gently intoxicated. The springtime is a provisional aradise, the sun helps man to have patience.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.11#There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having the zure of heaven, say: “It is enough!” dreamers absorbed in the wonderful, ipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and evil, contemplators f cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do not understand how people can ccupy themselves with the hunger of these, and the thirst of those, with the udity of the poor in winter, with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal olumn, with the pallet, the attic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young irls, when they can dream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits hey, and pitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices them. That reat need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore. The finite hich admits of progress and sublime toil, they do not think about. The ndefinite, which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite nd the finite, escapes them. Provided that they are face to face with mmensity, they smile. Joy never, ecstasy forever. Their life lies in urrendering their personality in contemplation. The history of humanity is for hem only a detailed plan. All is not there; the true All remains without; what s the use of busying oneself over that detail, man? Man suffers, that is quite ossible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more milk, the ew-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, but just look at this onderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents under the icroscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace to that if you can! These hinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it revents their seeing the weeping child. God eclipses their souls. This is a amily of minds which are, at once, great and petty. Horace was one of them; so as Goethe. La Fontaine perhaps; magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil pectators of sorrow, who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom he sun conceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an execution by the uillotine in the search for an effect of light, who hear neither the cry nor he sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everything is well, ince there is a month of May, who, so long as there are clouds of purple and old above their heads, declare themselves content, and who are determined to be appy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are xhausted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.12#These are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to be itied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.13#The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superior hilosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is some infirmity. One ay be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan. One may be more than man and less han man. There is incomplete immensity in nature. Who knows whether the sun is ot a blind man?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.14#But then, what? In whom can we trust? _Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?_ ho shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain geniuses, themselves, ertain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? That which is on high at he summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which sends down so much light on he earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees not at all? Is not this a desperate tate of things? No. But what is there, then, above the sun? The god.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.15#On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o’clock in the morning, the uxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes and lower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. The branches, ild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoring to embrace. In the ycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows triumphed, woodpeckers limbed along the chestnut trees, administering little pecks on the bark. The lower-beds accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies; the most august of erfumes is that which emanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the arnations was perceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the all trees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips, hich are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers. All around he banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers, hummed. All was race and gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse, by which the lilies of he valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit, had nothing disturbing bout it; the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low. He who was here aspired to happiness; life smelled good; all nature exhaled candor, help, ssistance, paternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts which fell from heaven were as weet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.16#The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow pierced ith light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight; rays hung from them n all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth was already dried up to the oint of being burnt. There was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections f dust here and there.

The clumps of blossoms had just been bathed; very sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs from the earth in he form of flowers, was irreproachable. This magnificence was cleanly. The rand silence of happy nature filled the garden. A celestial silence that is ompatible with a thousand sorts of music, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of warms, the flutterings of the breeze. All the harmony of the season was omplete in one gracious whole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in roper order; the lilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, ome insects in advance of their time; the van-guard of the red June butterflies raternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of May. The plantain rees were getting their new skins. The breeze hollowed out undulations in the agnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. It was splendid. A veteran from the eighboring barracks, who was gazing through the fence, said: “Here is the pring presenting arms and in full uniform.”

The ring-dove found his hemp-seed, the haffinch found his millet, the goldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found orms, the green finch found flies, the fly found infusoriæ, the bee found lowers.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.56#They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, as hey are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with the stupid ajesty which befits white creatures.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.16.57#“The swans [_cygnes_] understand signs [_signes_],” said the bourgeois, elighted to make a jest.

The swans, erceiving the enemy, made haste, and in so doing, they produced an effect of heir breasts which was of service to the little fisher; the water flowed back efore the swans, and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated he brioche towards the child’s wand. Just as the swans came up, the stick ouched the cake. The child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened way the swans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The cake was wet; but hey were hungry and thirsty. The elder broke the cake into two portions, a arge one and a small one, took the small one for himself, gave the large one to is brother, and said to him:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.17.15#One thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering the arricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversed the hirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular moments of ranquillity mingled with these convulsions. Men go and come, they talk, they est, they lounge. Some one whom we know heard a combatant say to him in the idst of the grape-shot: “We are here as at a bachelor breakfast.” The redoubt f the Rue de la Chanvrerie, we repeat, seemed very calm within. All mutations nd all phases had been, or were about to be, exhausted. The position, from ritical, had become menacing, and, from menacing, was probably about to become esperate. In proportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism mpurpled the barricade more and more. Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it, in he attitude of a young Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre enius, Epidotas.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.17.16#Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet and Feuilly ere making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by Gavroche on the dead orporal, and Bossuet said to Feuilly: “We are soon to take the diligence for nother planet”; Courfeyrac was disposing and arranging on some paving-stones hich he had reserved for himself near Enjolras, a complete arsenal, his word-cane, his gun, two holster pistols, and a cudgel, with the care of a young irl setting a small dunkerque in order. Jean Valjean stared silently at the all opposite him. An artisan was fastening Mother Hucheloup’s big straw hat on is head with a string, “for fear of sun-stroke,” as he said. The young men from he Cougourde d’Aix were chatting merrily among themselves, as though eager to peak patois for the last time. Joly, who had taken Widow Hucheloup’s mirror rom the wall, was examining his tongue in it. Some combatants, having iscovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread, in a drawer, were eagerly evouring them. Marius was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to ay to him.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.3#There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of the nknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes, and any ne who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a dream.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.4#The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in he case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are both more and ess than life. On emerging from a barricade, one no longer knows what one has een there. One has been terrible, but one knows it not. One has been surrounded ith conflicting ideas which had human faces; one’s head has been in the light f the future. There were corpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing rect. The hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in eath. Shadows have passed by. What were they?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.5#One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafening orror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths which houted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in the midst of moke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of nknown depths; one stares at something red on one’s finger nails. One no longer emembers anything.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.6#Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.7#All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock striking he hour became audible.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.8#“It is midday,” said Combeferre.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.9#The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to his eet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.11#A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made their ppearance in battle array at the end of the street.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.12#This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? The attacking olumn, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition of the barricade must lways precede the soldiers who are to scale it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.13#They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M. lermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called “the tug of war.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.14#Enjolras’ order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar to hips and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible. n less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which Enjolras had had piled up t the door of Corinthe had been carried up to the first floor and the attic, nd before a second minute had elapsed, these stones, artistically set one upon he other, walled up the sash-window on the first floor and the windows in the oof to half their height. A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the rincipal architect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament of he windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot ad ceased. The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the arrier in order to make a hole there, and, if possible, a breach for the ssault.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.15#When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras had he bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay, carried to the irst floor.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.17#“They,” replied Enjolras.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.18#Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the iron ross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.19#The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shop as the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.20#As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of their mmunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants combine their rrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, expose themselves to fire rematurely, though in appearance more than in reality, and take their ease. The reparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical deliberation; fter which, the lightning strikes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.18.21#This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything and to erfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, their death ought o be a masterpiece.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.20.3#For, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue de la hanvrerie had become two walls; ferocious walls, doors closed, windows closed, hutters closed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.20.4#In those days, so different from those in which we live, when the hour was ome, when the people wished to put an end to a situation, which had lasted too ong, with a charter granted or with a legal country, when universal wrath was iffused in the atmosphere, when the city consented to the tearing up of the avements, when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its assword in its ear, then the inhabitant, thoroughly penetrated with the revolt, o to speak, was the auxiliary of the combatant, and the house fraternized with he improvised fortress which rested on it. When the situation was not ripe, hen the insurrection was not decidedly admitted, when the masses disowned the ovement, all was over with the combatants, the city was changed into a desert round the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges were nailed up, and the street urned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.20.5#A people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly than it hooses. Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people does not let itself o at random. Then it abandons the insurrection to itself. The insurgents become oxious, infected with the plague. A house is an escarpment, a door is a efusal, a façade is a wall. This wall hears, sees and will not. It might open nd save you. No. This wall is a judge. It gazes at you and condemns you. What ismal things are closed houses. They seem dead, they are living. Life which is, s it were, suspended there, persists there. No one has gone out of them for our and twenty hours, but no one is missing from them. In the interior of that ock, people go and come, go to bed and rise again; they are a family party here; there they eat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! Fear excuses his fearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed with it, an extenuating ircumstance. Sometimes, even, and this has been actually seen, fear turns to assion; fright may change into fury, as prudence does into rage; hence this ise saying: “The enraged moderates.” There are outbursts of supreme terror, hence springs wrath like a mournful smoke.—“What do these people want? What ave they come there to do? Let them get out of the scrape. So much the worse or them. It is their fault. They are only getting what they deserve. It does ot concern us. Here is our poor street all riddled with balls. They are a pack f rascals. Above all things, don’t open the door.”—And the house assumes the ir of a tomb. The insurgent is in the death-throes in front of that house; he ees the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if he cries, he knows that hey are listening to him, and that no one will come; there stand walls which ight protect him, there are men who might save him; and these walls have ears f flesh, and these men have bowels of stone.

It complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is ust that it should be held to answer; a violence of occasion and expedient, ontrary to principle, and for which it is fatally punished. The Utopia, nsurrection, fights with the old military code in its fist; it shoots spies, it xecutes traitors; it suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown arkness. It makes use of death, a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had o longer any faith in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force. It trikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple.

An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth; hence he appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at a government or a égime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and we insist upon it, what the chiefs f the insurrection of 1832, and, in particular, the young enthusiasts of the ue de la Chanvrerie were combating, was not precisely Louis Philippe. The ajority of them, when talking freely, did justice to this king who stood midway etween monarchy and revolution; no one hated him. But they attacked the younger ranch of the divine right in Louis Philippe as they had attacked its elder ranch in Charles X.; and that which they wished to overturn in overturning oyalty in France, was, as we have explained, the usurpation of man over man, nd of privilege over right in the entire universe. Paris without a king has as esult the world without despots.

The annon, though it had not effected a practicable breach, had made a rather large ollow in the middle of the redoubt; there, the summit of the wall had isappeared before the balls, and had crumbled away; and the rubbish which had allen, now inside, now outside, had, as it accumulated, formed two piles in the ature of slopes on the two sides of the barrier, one on the inside, the other n the outside. The exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the ttack.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.22.2#A final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. The mass ristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run, came up with irresistible orce, and the serried front of battle of the attacking column made its ppearance through the smoke on the crest of the battlements. This time, it was ecisive. The group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated in onfusion.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.22.3#Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. Many, finding hemselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, did not wish to die. This s a moment when the instinct of self-preservation emits howls, when the beast eappears in men. They were hemmed in by the lofty, six-story house which formed he background of their redoubt. This house might prove their salvation. The uilding was barricaded, and walled, as it were, from top to bottom. Before the roops of the line had reached the interior of the redoubt, there was time for a oor to open and shut, the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for hat, and the door of that house, suddenly opened a crack and closed again nstantly, was life for these despairing men. Behind this house, there were treets, possible flight, space. They set to knocking at that door with the utts of their guns, and with kicks, shouting, calling, entreating, wringing heir hands. No one opened. From the little window on the third floor, the head f the dead man gazed down upon them.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.22.4#But Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them, sprang orward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers: “Don’t dvance!” and as an officer had not obeyed, Enjolras had killed the officer. He as now in the little inner court of the redoubt, with his back planted against he Corinthe building, a sword in one hand, a rifle in the other, holding open he door of the wine-shop which he barred against assailants. He shouted to the esperate men:—“There is but one door open; this one.”—And shielding them with is body, and facing an entire battalion alone, he made them pass in behind him. ll precipitated themselves thither. Enjolras, executing with his rifle, which e now used like a cane, what single-stick players call a “covered rose” round is head, levelled the bayonets around and in front of him, and was the last to nter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when the soldiers tried to make their ay in, and the insurgents strove to bar them out. The door was slammed with uch violence, that, as it fell back into its frame, it showed the five fingers f a soldier who had been clinging to it, cut off and glued to the post.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.22.5#Marius remained outside. A shot had just broken his collar bone, he felt hat he was fainting and falling. At that moment, with eyes already shut, he elt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, and the swoon in which his senses anished, hardly allowed him time for the thought, mingled with a last memory of osette:—“I am taken prisoner. I shall be shot.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.22.6#Enjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in the ine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment when each man has ot the time to meditate on his own death. Enjolras fixed the bar across the oor, and bolted it, and double-locked it with key and chain, while those utside were battering furiously at it, the soldiers with the butts of their uskets, the sappers with their axes. The assailants were grouped about that oor. The siege of the wine-shop was now beginning.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.22.8#The death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then, a still ore melancholy circumstance. During the few hours which had preceded the ttack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents were mutilating heir prisoners, and that there was the headless body of a soldier in the ine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usual accompaniment of civil wars, nd it was a false report of this kind which, later on, produced the catastrophe f the Rue Transnonain.

The ssailants, rushing into the wine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of he door which had been beaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single ombatant there. The spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the iddle of the tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, every ne who was not killed was on the first floor, and from there, through the hole n the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs, a terrific fire urst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. When they were exhausted, when hese formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball, ach grasped in his hands two of the bottles which Enjolras had reserved, and of hich we have spoken, and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully ragile clubs. They were bottles of aquafortis.

Greek fire did not disgrace rchimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. All war is a thing of terror, nd there is no choice in it. The musketry of the besiegers, though confined and mbarrassed by being directed from below upwards, was deadly. The rim of the ole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain, whence ripped long, red and smoking streams, the uproar was indescribable; a close and urning smoke almost produced night over this combat. Words are lacking to xpress horror when it has reached this pitch. There were no longer men in this onflict, which was now infernal. They were no longer giants matched with olossi.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.1.23.1#At length, by dint of mounting on each other’s backs, aiding themselves ith the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up the walls, clinging to the eiling, slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door, the last one who ffered resistance, a score of assailants, soldiers, National Guardsmen, unicipal guardsmen, in utter confusion, the majority disfigured by wounds in he face during that redoubtable ascent, blinded by blood, furious, rendered avage, made an irruption into the apartment on the first floor. There they ound only one man still on his feet, Enjolras. Without cartridges, without word, he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he ad broken over the head of those who were entering. He had placed the billiard able between his assailants and himself; he had retreated into the corner of he room, and there, with haughty eye, and head borne high, with this stump of a eapon in his hand, he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty pace around him.

As soon as Enjolras folded is arms and accepted his end, the din of strife ceased in the room, and this haos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity. The menacing majesty f Enjolras disarmed and motionless, appeared to oppress this tumult, and this oung man, haughty, bloody, and charming, who alone had not a wound, who was as ndifferent as an invulnerable being, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil lance, to constrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, t that moment augmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was fresh and osy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed, as though e could no more be fatigued than wounded. It was of him, possibly, that a itness spoke afterwards, before the council of war: “There was an insurgent hom I heard called Apollo.” A National Guardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, owered his gun, saying: “It seems to me that I am about to shoot a flower.”

Nothing had had any effect upon it, neither the fusillade, nor the annon-balls, nor the grape-shot which had made its way through the window into he room where he was.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.2.4#Sinks and sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, in the Lower mpire and in the Orient of old. The masses regarded these beds of ecomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, with a fear that was almost eligious. The vermin ditch of Benares is no less conducive to giddiness than he lions’ ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, according to the rabbinical ooks, swore by the sink of Nineveh. It was from the sewer of Münster that John f Leyden produced his false moon, and it was from the cesspool of Kekscheb that riental menalchme, Mokanna, the veiled prophet of Khorassan, caused his false un to emerge.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.2.5#The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. The Germoniæ58 arrated Rome. The sewer of Paris has been an ancient and formidable thing. It as been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum. Crime, intelligence, social rotest, liberty of conscience, thought, theft, all that human laws persecute or ave persecuted, is hidden in that hole; the _maillotins_ in the fourteenth entury, the _tire-laine_ of the fifteenth, the Huguenots in the sixteenth, orin’s _illuminated_ in the seventeenth, the _chauffeurs_ [brigands] in the ighteenth. A hundred years ago, the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged hence, the pickpocket in danger slipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris ad its sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic _picareria_, accepted the sewer as the djunct of the Cour des Miracles, and at evening, it returned thither, fierce nd sly, through the Maubuée outlet, as into a bed-chamber.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.2.6#It was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset, Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the scene of their daily abor, should have for their domicile by night the culvert of the Chemin-Vert, r the catch basin of Hurepoix. Hence a throng of souvenirs. All sorts of hantoms haunt these long, solitary corridors; everywhere is putrescence and iasma; here and there are breathing-holes, where Villon within converses with abelais without.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.2.7#The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of all ttempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, social philosophy there eholds a residuum.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.2.8#The sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there converges and onfronts everything else. In that livid spot there are shades, but there are no onger any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or at least, its definitive orm. The mass of filth has this in its favor, that it is not a liar. ngenuousness has taken refuge there. The mask of Basil is to be found there, ut one beholds its cardboard and its strings and the inside as well as the utside, and it is accentuated by honest mud. Scapin’s false nose is its ext-door neighbor. All the uncleannesses of civilization, once past their use, all into this trench of truth, where the immense social sliding ends. They are here engulfed, but they display themselves there. This mixture is a confession. here, no more false appearances, no plastering over is possible, filth removes ts shirt, absolute denudation puts to the rout all illusions and mirages, there s nothing more except what really exists, presenting the sinister form of that hich is coming to an end. There, the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness, basket-handle tells a tale of domesticity; there the core of an apple which as entertained literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; the effigy on he big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, Caiphas’ spittle meets alstaff’s puking, the louis-d’or which comes from the gaming-house jostles the ail whence hangs the rope’s end of the suicide. A livid fœtus rolls along, nveloped in the spangles which danced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap hich has pronounced judgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which as formerly Margoton’s petticoat; it is more than fraternization, it is quivalent to addressing each other as _thou_. All which was formerly rouged, is ashed free. The last veil is torn away. A sewer is a cynic. It tells verything.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.2.9#The sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul. When one has assed one’s time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airs which easons of state, the oath, political sagacity, human justice, professional robity, the austerities of situation, incorruptible robes all assume, it olaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire which befits it.

The Saint-Barthélemys filter through there, drop by rop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations, political and eligious butcheries, traverse this underground passage of civilization, and hrust their corpses there. For the eye of the thinker, all historic murderers re to be found there, in that hideous penumbra, on their knees, with a scrap of heir winding-sheet for an apron, dismally sponging out their work. Louis XI. is here with Tristan, François I. with Duprat, Charles IX. is there with his other, Richelieu is there with Louis XIII., Louvois is there, Letellier is here, Hébert and Maillard are there, scratching the stones, and trying to make he traces of their actions disappear. Beneath these vaults one hears the brooms f spectres. One there breathes the enormous fetidness of social catastrophes. ne beholds reddish reflections in the corners. There flows a terrible stream, n which bloody hands have been washed.

Everything desires to lee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation is useless. What side of neself does one display in evasions? the shameful side. Philosophy pursues with ts glance, probes the evil, and does not permit it to escape into nothingness. n the obliteration of things which disappear, in the watching of things which anish, it recognizes all. It reconstructs the purple from the rag, and the oman from the scrap of her dress. From the cesspool, it reconstitutes the city; rom mud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphora or he jug. By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, it recognizes he difference which separates the Jewry of the Judengasse from the Jewry of the hetto. It re-discovers in what remains that which has been, good, evil, the rue, the blood-stain of the palace, the ink-blot of the cavern, the drop of weat from the brothel, trials undergone, temptations welcomed, orgies cast orth, the turn which characters have taken as they became abased, the trace of rostitution in souls of which their grossness rendered them capable, and on the esture of the porters of Rome the mark of Messalina’s elbowing.

It did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally or aterially, and could not sweep out filth any better than it could abuses. verything presented an obstacle, everything raised a question. The sewer, for xample, was refractory to every itinerary. One could no more find one’s earings in the sewer than one could understand one’s position in the city; bove the unintelligible, below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of ongues there reigned the confusion of caverns; Dædalus backed up Babel.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.3.3#Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though this isunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. There occurred, nfamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, that stomach of ivilization digested badly, the cesspool flowed back into the throat of the ity, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth. These resemblances of the ewer to remorse had their good points; they were warnings; very badly accepted, owever; the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its mire, and did not admit hat the filth should return. Drive it out better.

It attained its maximum depth in the Rue aint-Pierre, where it rose to the height of three feet above the flag-stones of he water-spout, and its maximum length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it spread ut over a stretch two hundred and thirty-eight metres in length.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.3.5#At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a mysterious lace. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case its evil renown reached he verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confused way, that she had under her terrible cavern. People talked of it as of that monstrous bed of Thebes in hich swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length, and which might have erved Behemoth for a bathtub. The great boots of the sewermen never ventured urther than certain well-known points. We were then very near the epoch when he scavenger’s carts, from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the arquis de Créqui, discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As for leaning out,—that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered ather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer, and called it the emoniæ; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the Polypus-Hole. Science and uperstition were in accord, in horror. The Polypus hole was no less repugnant o hygiene than to legend. The goblin was developed under the fetid covering of he Mouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer e la Barillerie; Fagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to he great hiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 n the Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the _Gallant Messenger_. The outh of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated for the estilences which had their source there; with its grating of iron, with points imulating a row of teeth, it was like a dragon’s maw in that fatal street, reathing forth hell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the sombre arisian sink with some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. The ewer had no bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea of exploring these eprous regions did not even occur to the police. To try that unknown thing, to ast the plummet into that shadow, to set out on a voyage of discovery in that byss—who would have dared? It was alarming. Nevertheless, some one did present imself. The cesspool had its Christopher Columbus.

In the Carrousel there was audible the clanking of words of all those extraordinary soldiers of the great Republic, and of the reat Empire; then Napoleon’s door was blocked with heroes; men from the Rhine, rom the Escaut, from the Adige, and from the Nile; companions of Joubert, of esaix, of Marceau, of Hoche, of Kléber; the aérostiers of Fleurus, the renadiers of Mayence, the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids ad looked down upon, artillerists whom Junot’s cannon-ball had spattered with ud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the uyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi, others had ccompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua, others had preceded Lannes in the ollow road of Montebello.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.4.1#The visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battle gainst pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyage of iscovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligent workingman, ho was very young at the time, related curious details with regard to it, everal years ago, which Bruneseau thought himself obliged to omit in his report o the prefect of police, as unworthy of official style. The processes of isinfection were, at that epoch, extremely rudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau rossed the first articulations of that subterranean network, when eight aborers out of the twenty refused to go any further. The operation was omplicated; the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning; hence it was ecessary to cleanse and at the same time, to proceed; to note the entrances of ater, to count the gratings and the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, o indicate the currents at the point where they parted, to define the espective bounds of the divers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the rincipal sewer, to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, and he width, at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, in order to etermine the arrangements with regard to the level of each water-entrance, ither of the bottom of the arch, or on the soil of the street. They advanced ith toil. The lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere. From time to time, a ainting sewerman was carried out. At certain points, there were precipices. The oil had given away, the pavement had crumbled, the sewer had changed into a ottomless well; they found nothing solid; a man disappeared suddenly; they had reat difficulty in getting him out again. On the advice of Fourcroy, they ighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin, from time to time, in pots which had been sufficiently disinfected. In some places, the wall was overed with misshapen fungi,—one would have said tumors; the very stone seemed iseased within this unbreathable atmosphere.

At the point of eparation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered upon a rojecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated the limits where hilibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting the subterranean drains of aris, had halted. This stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the ewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the onceau drain of the old Rue Vieille-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; nd the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting anal, walled and vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ncient, that of 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the elt sewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water of énilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, an dvancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first _valet de hambre_ to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.

An iron neck-collar was hanging in one of these cells. They alled them all up. Some of their finds were singular; among others, the keleton of an ourang-outan, who had disappeared from the Jardin des Plantes in 800, a disappearance probably connected with the famous and indisputable pparition of the devil in the Rue des Bernardins, in the last year of the ighteenth century. The poor devil had ended by drowning himself in the ewer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.4.4#Beneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion, a erfectly preserved rag-picker’s basket excited the admiration of all onnoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handle with ntrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of gold and silver, precious tones, coins. If a giant had filtered this cesspool, he would have had the iches of centuries in his lair. At the point where the two branches of the Rue u Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoye separate, they picked up a singular uguenot medal in copper, bearing on one side the pig hooded with a cardinal’s at, and on the other, a wolf with a tiara on his head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.4.5#The most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer. This ntrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but the hinges emained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless rag which, rrested there in its passage, no doubt, had floated there in the darkness and inished its process of being torn apart. Bruneseau held his lantern close to his rag and examined it. It was of very fine batiste, and in one of the orners, less frayed than the rest, they made out a heraldic coronet and mbroidered above these seven letters: LAVBESP. The crown was the coronet of a arquis, and the seven letters signified _Laubespine_. They recognized the fact, hat what they had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of Marat. Marat n his youth had had amorous intrigues. This was when he was a member of the ousehold of the Comte d’Artois, in the capacity of physician to the Stables. rom these love affairs, historically proved, with a great lady, he had retained his sheet. As a waif or a souvenir. At his death, as this was the only linen of ny fineness which he had in his house, they buried him in it. Some old women ad shrouded him for the tomb in that swaddling-band in which the tragic Friend f the people had enjoyed voluptuousness. Bruneseau passed on. They left that ag where it hung; they did not put the finishing touch to it. Did this arise rom scorn or from respect? Marat deserved both. And then, destiny was there ufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it. Besides, the things of he sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select. In short, the relic as a strange one. A Marquise had slept in it; Marat had rotted in it; it had raversed the Pantheon to end with the rats of the sewer. This chamber rag, of hich Watteau would formerly have joyfully sketched every fold, had ended in ecoming worthy of the fixed gaze of Dante.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.4.6#The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lasted seven ears, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew, directed, and ompleted considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the arch of the Ponceau, and, verywhere creating new lines, he pushed the sewer, in 1809, under the Rue aint-Denis as far as the fountain of the Innocents; in 1810, under the Rue roidmanteau and under the Salpêtrière; in 1811 under the Rue euve-des-Petits-Pères, under the Rue du Mail, under the Rue de l‘Écharpe, under he Place Royale; in 1812, under the Rue de la Paix, and under the Chaussée ’Antin. At the same time, he had the whole network disinfected and rendered ealthful. In the second year of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance of is son-in-law Nargaud.

Ramifications in every direction, crossings, of trenches, branches, oose-feet, stars, as in military mines, cœcum, blind alleys, vaults lined with altpetre, pestiferous pools, scabby sweats, on the walls, drops dripping from he ceilings, darkness; nothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, he digestive apparatus of Babylon, a cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, titanic mole-burrow, where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind mole, he past, prowling through the shadows, in the filth which has been plendor.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.5.1#To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes the deal of what is understood in England by the word “respectable.” It is proper nd grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost say as though it came ut of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state. ne can almost see distinctly there. The mire there comports itself with ecency. At first, one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean orridors, which were so common in former days, and so useful in flights of onarchs and princes, in those good old times, “when the people loved their ings.” The present sewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; the lassical rectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, appears to have aken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of that long, ark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves as attern even in the sewer. However, if the geometrical line is in place nywhere, it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city. There, verything should be subordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, ssumed a certain official aspect. The very police reports, of which it ometimes forms the subject, no longer are wanting in respect towards it. The ords which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and ignified. What used to be called a gut is now called a gallery; what used to be alled a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon would no longer meet ith his ancient temporary provisional lodging. This network of cellars has its mmemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming in greater numbers than ver; from time to time, an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of he sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermin grow tame, so atisfied are they with their subterranean palace. The cesspool no longer etains anything of its primitive ferocity. The rain, which in former days oiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, do not trust yourself too much to t. Miasmas still inhabit it. It is more hypocritical than irreproachable. The refecture of police and the commission of health have done their best. But, in pite of all the processes of disinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor ike Tartuffe after confession.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.head#CHAPTER VI—FUTURE PROGRESS
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.1#The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last ten enturies have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination, any ore than they have been able to finish Paris. The sewer, in fact, receives all he counter-shocks of the growth of Paris. Within the bosom of the earth, it is sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennæ, which expands below as the ity expands above. Every time that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches ut an arm. The old monarchy had constructed only twenty-three thousand three undred metres of sewers; that was where Paris stood in this respect on the irst of January, 1806. Beginning with this epoch, of which we shall shortly peak, the work was usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted; Napoleon uilt—the figures are curious—four thousand eight hundred and four metres; Louis VIII., five thousand seven hundred and nine; Charles X., ten thousand eight undred and thirty-six; Louis-Philippe, eighty-nine thousand and twenty; the epublic of 1848, twenty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-one; the resent government, seventy thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time, wo hundred and twenty-six thousand six hundred and ten metres; sixty leagues of ewers; the enormous entrails of Paris. An obscure ramification ever at work; a onstruction which is immense and ignored.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.2#As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day more than en times what it was at the beginning of the century. It is difficult to form ny idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to ring this cesspool to the point of relative perfection in which it now is. It as with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical provostship and, during he last ten years of the eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had ucceeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 806. All sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to the soil, thers inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population of Paris. aris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to the pick, the hoe, he bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothing more difficult to pierce nd to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed the arvellous historical formation called Paris; as soon as work in any form hatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium, subterranean esistances abound. There are liquid clays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft nd deep quagmires which special science calls _moutardes_.59 The pick advances aboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads f clay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, the ontemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts hrough a vault that has been begun, and inundates the laborers; or a layer of arl is laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of a cataract, breaking the toutest supporting beams like glass. Quite recently, at Villette, when it ecame necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the Saint-Martin canal ithout interrupting navigation or emptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the asin of the canal, water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel, hich was beyond the power of the pumping engines; it was necessary to send a iver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the rand basin, and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped up. lsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distance from the river, as or instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and Lumière Passage, quicksands are ncountered in which one sticks fast, and in which a man sinks visibly. Add uffocation by miasmas, burial by slides, and sudden crumbling of the earth. Add he typhus, with which the workmen become slowly impregnated. In our own day, fter having excavated the gallery of Clichy, with a banquette to receive the rincipal water-conduit of Ourcq, a piece of work which was executed in a trench en metres deep; after having, in the midst of land-slides, and with the aid of xcavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted the Bièvre from the oulevard de l’Hôpital, as far as the Seine; after having, in order to deliver aris from the floods of Montmartre and in order to provide an outlet for that iver-like pool nine hectares in extent, which crouched near the Barrière des artyrs, after having, let us state, constructed the line of sewers from the arrière Blanche to the road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day and ight, at a depth of eleven metres; after having—a thing heretofore unseen—made subterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, six metres below he surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died. After having vaulted three housand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city, from the Rue raversière-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l’Ourcine, after having freed the arrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of rain by means of the branch of he Arbalète, after having built the Saint-Georges sewer, on rock and concrete n the fluid sands, after having directed the formidable lowering of the looring of the vault timber in the Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the ngineer died. There are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these, which re more useful, nevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of attle.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.3#The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day. runeseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required to bring about the ast reconstruction which took place later on. It is surprising to say, for xample, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer, called the Grand Canal, as in enice, still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. It as only in 1821 that the city of Paris found in its pocket the two hundred and ixty-thousand eighty francs and six centimes required for covering this mass of ilth. The three absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mandé, ith their discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and their epuratory branches, only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of Paris has been ade over anew, and, as we have said, it has been extended more than tenfold ithin the last quarter of a century.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.4#Thirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of une, it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer. A very reat number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways. At the nd of a slope, where the tributaries of a street or crossroads ended, there ere often to be seen large, square gratings with heavy bars, whose iron, olished by the footsteps of the throng, gleamed dangerous and slippery for ehicles, and caused horses to fall. The official language of the Roads and ridges gave to these gratings the expressive name of _Cassis_.60
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.5#In 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l‘Étoile, the Rue aint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vieille-du-Temple, the Rue Notre-Dame de azareth, the Rue Folie-Méricourt, the Quai aux Fleurs, the Rue du Petit-Musc, he Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches, the Rue des Marais, the Faubourg aint-Martin, the Rue Notre Dame des-Victoires, the Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue range-Batelière, in the Champs-Élysées, the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, the ncient gothic sewer still cynically displayed its maw. It consisted of enormous oids of stone catch-basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts, with monumental ffrontery.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.6#Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in 663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1st of anuary, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. Between 1806 and 831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred and fifty metres nnually, afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries were onstructed every year, in masonry, of small stones, with hydraulic mortar which ardens under water, on a cement foundation. At two hundred francs the metre, he sixty leagues of Paris’ sewers of the present day represent forty-eight illions.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.7#In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the eginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that immense uestion: the sewers of Paris.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.2.6.8#Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air. The heet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, but already ounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green clay situated between he chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may be represented by a disk ive and twenty leagues in circumference; a multitude of rivers and brooks ooze here; one drinks the Seine, the Marne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the her, the Vienne and the Loire in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. he sheet of water is healthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next rom the earth; the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All the iasms of the cesspool are mingled with the breath of the city; hence this bad reath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been scientifically proved, s purer than the air taken from above Paris. In a given time, with the aid of rogress, mechanisms become perfected, and as light increases, the sheet of ater will be employed to purify the sheet of air; that is to say, to wash the ewer. The reader knows, that by “washing the sewer” we mean: the restitution of he filth to the earth; the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the ields. Through this simple act, the entire social community will experience a iminution of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present hour, the adiation of diseases from Paris extends to fifty leagues around the Louvre, aken as the hub of this pestilential wheel.

The popular nstinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation of sewermen was formerly lmost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to the people, as the occupation of nacker, which was so long held in horror and handed over to the executioner. igh wages were necessary to induce a mason to disappear in that fetid mine; the adder of the cesspool cleaner hesitated to plunge into it; it was said, in roverbial form: “to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave;” and all orts of hideous legends, as we have said, covered this colossal sink with error; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces of the revolutions of the globe s of the revolutions of man, and where are to be found vestiges of all ataclysms from the shells of the Deluge to the rag of Marat.

Adorable ambuscades of providence!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.5#Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not know whether hat which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead orpse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.6#His first sensation was one of blindness. All of a sudden, he could see othing. It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become deaf. He no onger heard anything. The frantic storm of murder which had been let loose a ew feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to the thickness of the earth hich separated him from it, as we have said, otherwise than faintly and ndistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the depths. He felt that the ground was olid under his feet; that was all; but that was enough. He extended one arm and hen the other, touched the walls on both sides, and perceived that the passage as narrow; he slipped, and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He autiously put forward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he iscovered that the paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him of the lace in which he stood.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.7#After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little light ell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyes became ccustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish something. The passage in hich he had burrowed—no other word can better express the situation—was walled n behind him. It was one of those blind alleys, which the special jargon terms ranches. In front of him there was another wall, a wall like night. The light f the air-hole died out ten or twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean tood, and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the ewer. Beyond, the opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed horrible, n entrance into it appeared like an engulfment. A man could, however, plunge nto that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do. Haste was even requisite. t occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under he flag-stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and that everything ung upon this chance. They also might descend into that well and search it. here was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Marius on the ground, he icked him up again,—that is the real word for it,—placed him on his shoulders nce more, and set out. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.9#When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt. A problem resented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which he encountered cross his path. There two ways presented themselves. Which should he take? ught he to turn to the left or to the right? How was he to find his bearings in hat black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to which we have already called the eader’s attention, has a clue, which is its slope.

Perhaps he would come out on ome man-hole at the intersection of streets. Amazement of the passers-by at eholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the olice, a call to arms of the neighboring post of guards. Thus they would be eized before they had even got out.

Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as possible. Marius’ wo arms were passed round his neck, and the former’s feet dragged behind him. e held both these arms with one hand, and groped along the wall with the other. arius’ cheek touched his, and clung there, bleeding. He felt a warm stream hich came from Marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his lothes. But a humid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded man ouched, indicated respiration, and consequently, life. The passage along which ean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first. Jean Valjean alked through it with considerable difficulty. The rain of the preceding day ad not, as yet, entirely run off, and it created a little torrent in the centre f the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet n the water.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.18#Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder. He thought that he was beneath he Rue Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so. Under the Rue aint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis XIII. and which uns straight to the collecting sewer, called the Grand Sewer, with but a single lbow, on the right, on the elevation of the ancient Cour des Miracles, and a ingle branch, the Saint-Martin sewer, whose four arms describe a cross. But the ut of the Petite-Truanderie the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the orinthe wine-shop has never communicated with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; t ended at the Montmartre sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean was ntangled. There opportunities of losing oneself abound. The Montmartre sewer is ne of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network. Fortunately, Jean Valjean ad left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the ppearance of a multitude of parrots’ roosts piled on top of each other; but he ad before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street orner—for they are streets—presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation oint; first, on his left, the vast sewer of the Plâtrière, a sort of Chinese uzzle, thrusting out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zs under the ost-Office and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as far as the Seine, here it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, the curving corridor of the ue du Cadran with its three teeth, which are also blind courts; thirdly, on his eft, the branch of the Mail, complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort f fork, and proceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand crypt f the outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every direction; and astly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeûneurs, without counting ittle ducts here and there, before reaching the belt sewer, which alone could onduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.21#By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. The gloom hich enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked in an enigma. This aqueduct f the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion. It is a melancholy hing to be caught in this Paris of shadows. Jean Valjean was obliged to find nd even to invent his route without seeing it. In this unknown, every step that e risked might be his last. How was he to get out? should he find an issue? hould he find it in time? would that colossal subterranean sponge with its tone cavities, allow itself to be penetrated and pierced? should he there ncounter some unexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at the nextricable and the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of unger? should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in nook of that night? He did not know. He put all these questions to himself ithout replying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice. Like the rophet, he was in the belly of the monster.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.22#All at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, and without aving ceased to walk in a straight line, he perceived that he was no longer scending; the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels, instead of eeting him at his toes. The sewer was now descending. Why? Was he about to rrive suddenly at the Seine? This danger was a great one, but the peril of etreating was still greater. He continued to advance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.23#It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge which the oil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its watersheds into the eine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridge which etermines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line. The ulminating point, which is the point of separation of the currents, is in the ainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michel-le-Comte, in the sewer of the Louvre, ear the boulevards, and in the Montmartre sewer, near the Halles. It was this ulminating point that Jean Valjean had reached. He was directing his course owards the belt sewer; he was on the right path. But he did not know it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.24#Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, and if he ound that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in hich he was, he did not enter but continued his route, rightly judging that very narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley, and could only lead im further from his goal, that is to say, the outlet. Thus he avoided the uadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths hich we have just enumerated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.25#At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the aris which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades had suppressed irculation, and that he was entering beneath the living and normal Paris. verhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant but continuous. It was he rumbling of vehicles.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.26#He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according to the alculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not yet thought of rest; e had merely changed the hand with which he was holding Marius. The darkness as more profound than ever, but its very depth reassured him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.27#All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him. It was outlined on a aint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled the flooring ault underfoot, and the vault overhead, and gilded to his right and to his left he two viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied, he turned round.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.1.28#Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passed hrough, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the dense bscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying im.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.2#That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the lantern of he patrol of the right bank.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.3#This patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind alleys hich lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were passing their lantern hrough the depths of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean had encountered on his ath the entrance to the gallery, had perceived that it was narrower than the rincipal passage and had not penetrated thither. He had passed on. The police, n emerging from the gallery du Cadran, had fancied that they heard the sound of ootsteps in the direction of the belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of ean Valjean. The sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern, and he squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence the sound roceeded.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.5#Happily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but ill. It was ight and he was shadow. He was very far off, and mingled with the darkness of he place. He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did not understand what t was that was moving behind him. The lack of sleep and food, and his emotions ad caused him also to pass into the state of a visionary. He beheld a gleam, nd around that gleam, forms. What was it? He did not comprehend.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.7#The men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked and saw othing. They held a consultation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.8#There existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre sewer a sort of rossroads called _de service_, which was afterwards suppressed, on account of he little interior lake which formed there, swallowing up the torrent of rain n heavy storms. The patrol could form a cluster in this open space. Jean aljean saw these spectres form a sort of circle. These bull-dogs’ heads pproached each other closely and whispered together.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.9#The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had been istaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to get entangled in he belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time, but that they ought to asten towards Saint-Merry; that if there was anything to do, and any bousingot” to track out, it was in that quarter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.10#From time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, the word ousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, which had become bsolete, and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent ervice.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.12#If it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and to go in both irections, Jean Valjean would have been captured. All hung on that thread. It s probable that the instructions of the prefecture, foreseeing a possibility of ombat and insurgents in force, had forbidden the patrol to part company. The atrol resumed its march, leaving Jean Valjean behind it. Of all this movement, ean Valjean perceived nothing, except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly heeled round.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.13#Before taking his departure, the sergeant, in order to acquit his oliceman’s conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of Jean Valjean. The etonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like the rumbling of that itanic entrail. A bit of plaster which fell into the stream and splashed up the ater a few paces away from Jean Valjean, warned him that the ball had struck he arch over his head.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.2.14#Slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work, radually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; the group of black orms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated and floated, communicating to the ault a reddish glow which grew fainter, then disappeared; the silence became rofound once more, the obscurity became complete, blindness and deafness esumed possession of the shadows; and Jean Valjean, not daring to stir as yet, emained for a long time leaning with his back against the wall, with straining ars, and dilated pupils, watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.3.1#This justice must be rendered to the police of that period, that even in he most serious public junctures, it imperturbably fulfilled its duties onnected with the sewers and surveillance. A revolt was, in its eyes, no retext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths, and for eglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril. The ordinary ervice was performed correctly in company with the extraordinary service, and as not troubled by the latter. In the midst of an incalculable political event lready begun, under the pressure of a possible revolution, a police agent, spun” a thief without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and arricades.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.1#Jean Valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.2#This march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaults aries; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has been alculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend over, in rder not to strike Marius against the vault; at every step he had to bend, then o rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. The moisture of the stones, and he viscous nature of the timber framework furnished but poor supports to which o cling, either for hand or foot. He stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of he city. The intermittent gleams from the air-holes only appeared at very long ntervals, and were so wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the oon; all the rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean Valjean was oth hungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea, was a place ull of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, which was prodigious, as he reader knows, and which had been but little decreased by age, thanks to his haste and sober life, began to give way, nevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on im; and as his strength decreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. arius, who was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert bodies weigh. Jean aljean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed, and so that espiration could proceed as well as possible. Between his legs he felt the apid gliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to such a degree that he it him. From time to time, a breath of fresh air reached him through the ent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, and reanimated him.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.4#He was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening. He found himself, all t once, in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two alls, and beneath a vault which his head did not touch. The Grand Sewer is, in act, eight feet wide and seven feet high.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.5#At the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, two other ubterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of the Abattoir, orm a square. Between these four ways, a less sagacious man would have remained ndecided. Jean Valjean selected the broadest, that is to say, the belt-sewer. ut here the question again came up—should he descend or ascend? He thought that he situation required haste, and that he must now gain the Seine at any risk. n other terms, he must descend. He turned to the left.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.6#It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that the elt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the other towards assy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterranean girdle of the aris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, it must be remembered, othing else than the old brook of Ménilmontant, terminates, if one ascends it, n a blind sack, that is to say, at its ancient point of departure which was its ource, at the foot of the knoll of Ménilmontant. There is no direct ommunication with the branch which collects the waters of Paris beginning with he Quartier Popincourt, and which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer bove the ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes the collecting ewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Ménilmontant itself, by a pile which arks the dividing point of the waters, between upstream and downstream. If Jean aljean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived, after a thousand fforts, and broken down with fatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the loom, at a wall. He would have been lost.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.7#In case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, and entering the assage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did not hesitate at the ubterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and by taking the corridor aint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left, then turning to the right nd avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery, he might have reached the Amelot ewer, and thence, provided that he did not go astray in the sort of F which ies under the Bastille, he might have attained the outlet on the Seine near the rsenal. But in order to do this, he must have been thoroughly familiar with the normous madrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its penings. Now, we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain hich he was traversing; and had any one asked him in what he was, he would have nswered: “In the night.”

A passably large air-hole, probably the man-hole n the Rue d’Anjou, furnished a light that was almost vivid. Jean Valjean, with he gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded rother, deposited Marius on the banquette of the sewer. Marius’ blood-stained ace appeared under the wan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom f a tomb. His eyes were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples like painter’s brushes dried in red wash; his hands hung limp and dead. A clot of lood had collected in the knot of his cravat; his limbs were cold, and blood as clotted at the corners of his mouth; his shirt had thrust itself into his ounds, the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living lesh. Jean Valjean, pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers, aid his hand upon Marius’ breast; his heart was still beating. Jean Valjean ore up his shirt, bandaged the young man’s wounds as well as he was able and topped the flowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still lay unconscious nd almost without breathing, in that half light, he gazed at him with nexpressible hatred.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.4.11#On disarranging Marius’ garments, he had found two things in his pockets, he roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening, and Marius’ ocketbook.

He had eaten, his strength had returned to him; he ook Marius up once more upon his back, placed the latter’s head carefully on is right shoulder, and resumed his descent of the sewer.

Only the growing pallor of the pools of ight which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was ithdrawing from the pavement, and that the day would soon be over; and the olling of vehicles overhead, having become intermittent instead of continuous, hen having almost ceased, he concluded that he was no longer under central aris, and that he was approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the uter boulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses and treets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean. evertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in the dark.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.1#He felt that he was entering the water, and that he no longer had a avement under his feet, but only mud.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.2#It sometimes happens, that on certain shores of Bretagne or Scotland a man, ither a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on the beach far rom shore, suddenly notices that for several minutes past, he has been walking ith some difficulty. The beach under foot is like pitch; his soles stick fast o it; it is no longer sand, it is bird-lime. The strand is perfectly dry, but t every step that he takes, as soon as the foot is raised, the print is filled ith water. The eye, however, has perceived no change; the immense beach is mooth and tranquil, all the sand has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes the oil that is solid from that which is not solid; the joyous little cloud of and-lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the passer-by.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.3#The man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, endeavors to pproach the shore. He is not uneasy. Uneasy about what? Only he is conscious hat the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he akes. All at once he sinks in. He sinks in two or three inches. Decidedly, he s not on the right road; he halts to get his bearings. Suddenly he glances at is feet; his feet have disappeared. The sand has covered them. He draws his eet out of the sand, he tries to retrace his steps, he turns back, he sinks in ore deeply than before. The sand is up to his ankles, he tears himself free rom it and flings himself to the left, the sand reaches to mid-leg, he flings imself to the right, the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with indescribable error, he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand, and that he has eneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish can wim. He flings away his burden, if he have one, he lightens himself, like a hip in distress; it is too late, the sand is above his knees.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.4#He shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continually ains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, if the bank f sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the neighborhood, all is over, he s condemned to be engulfed. He is condemned to that terrible interment, long, nfallible, implacable, which it is impossible to either retard or hasten, which asts for hours, which will not come to an end, which seizes you erect, free, in he flush of health, which drags you down by the feet, which, at every effort hat you attempt, at every shout that you utter, draws you a little lower, which as the air of punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp, which orces a man to return slowly to earth, while leaving him time to survey the orizon, the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages on the plain, he sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly and sing, the sun and the ky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide, and which mounts rom the depths of the earth towards a living man. Each minute is an inexorable ayer-out of the dead. The wretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to limb; every movement that he makes buries him deeper; he straightens himself p, he sinks; he feels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, ries to the clouds, wrings his hands, grows desperate. Behold him in the sand p to his belly, the sand reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now. He plifts his hands, utters furious groans, clenches his nails on the beach, tries o cling fast to that ashes, supports himself on his elbows in order to raise imself from that soft sheath, and sobs frantically; the sand mounts higher. The and has reached his shoulders, the sand reaches to his throat; only his face is isible now. His mouth cries aloud, the sand fills it; silence. His eyes still aze forth, the sand closes them, night. Then his brow decreases, a little hair uivers above the sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface of the beach, waves nd disappears. Sinister obliteration of a man.

It is shipwreck lsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning a man. The earth, ermeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. It presents itself in the guise of plain, and it yawns like a wave. The abyss is subject to these reacheries.

A fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack, means crumbling. The ramework crumbled away for a certain length. This crevice, the hiatus of a gulf f mire, was called a _fontis_, in the special tongue. What is a _fontis?_ It is he quicksands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the arth; it is the beach of Mont Saint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked soil is in a tate of fusion, as it were; all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium; t is not earth and it is not water. The depth is sometimes very great. Nothing an be more formidable than such an encounter. If the water predominates, death s prompt, the man is swallowed up; if earth predominates, death is slow.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.9#Can any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed by the arth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cesspool? Instead of the open ir, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds, those free clouds hence rains life, instead of those barks descried in the distance, of that hope nder all sorts of forms, of probable passers-by, of succor possible up to the ery last moment,—instead of all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the nside of a tomb already prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover! slow uffocation by filth, a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and lutches you by the throat; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle; slime nstead of the strand, sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane, dung in lace of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one’s teeth, and to writhe, and to truggle, and to agonize, with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all, ver one’s head!
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.10#Inexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeems his trocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, in shipwreck, one an be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superb attitude is possible; one here becomes transfigured as one perishes. But not here. Death is filthy. It is umiliating to expire. The supreme floating visions are abject. Mud is ynonymous with shame. It is petty, ugly, infamous. To die in a butt of alvoisie, like Clarence, is permissible; in the ditch of a scavenger, like scoubleau, is horrible. To struggle therein is hideous; at the same time that ne is going through the death agony, one is floundering about. There are hadows enough for hell, and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough, and he dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre or a rog.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.12#The depth of the _fontis_ varied, as well as their length and their ensity, according to the more or less bad quality of the sub-soil. Sometimes a fontis_ was three or four feet deep, sometimes eight or ten; sometimes the ottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost solid, there almost liquid. In he Lunière fontis, it would have taken a man a day to disappear, while he would ave been devoured in five minutes by the Philippeaux slough. The mire bears up ore or less, according to its density. A child can escape where a man will erish. The first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load. Every ewerman who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his ack of tools, or his back-basket, or his hod.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.5.13#The fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil; some andslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summer rains; the ncessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers. Sometimes the weight of he surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the ubterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside, or it chanced that a looring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust. In this manner, the eaping up of the Parthénon, obliterated, a century ago, a portion of the vaults f Saint-Geneviève hill. When a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the ouses, the mischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of pace, like the teeth of a saw, between the paving-stones; this crevice was eveloped in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked ault, and then, the evil being visible, the remedy could be promptly applied. t also frequently happened, that the interior ravages were not revealed by any xternal scar, and in that case, woe to the sewermen. When they entered without recaution into the sewer, they were liable to be lost. Ancient registers make ention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in this manner. They ive many names; among others, that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a uagmire under the man-hole of the Rue Carême-Prenant, a certain Blaise outrain; this Blaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain, who was the ast grave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier des Innocents, in 1785, he epoch when that cemetery expired.

Madame de Sourdis, when informed of his death, demanded er smelling-bottle, and forgot to weep, through sniffling at her salts. In such ases, there is no love which holds fast; the sewer extinguishes it. Hero efuses to wash the body of Leander. Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of yramus and says: “Phew!”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.1#Jean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.2#This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the hamps-Élysées, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad reservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of its excessive luidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands of the uartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by a stone construction on concrete foundation, and the clayey strata, infected with gas, of the Quartier es Martyrs, which are so liquid that the only way in which a passage was ffected under the gallery des Martyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, n 1836, the old stone sewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in which we now ee Jean Valjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the uicksand, which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées as far as the Seine, resented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly six months, to the reat clamor of the dwellers on the riverside, particularly those who had hotels nd carriages. The work was more than unhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true hat they had four months and a half of rain, and three floods of the Seine.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.3#The fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour of he preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacent sand, had iven way and had produced a stoppage of the water. Infiltration had taken lace, a slip had followed. The dislocated bottom had sunk into the ooze. To hat extent? Impossible to say. The obscurity was more dense there than lsewhere. It was a pit of mire in a cavern of night.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.4#Jean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. He entered this lime. There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He must pass it. To etrace his steps was impossible. Marius was dying, and Jean Valjean exhausted. esides, where was he to go? Jean Valjean advanced. Moreover, the pit seemed, or the first few steps, not to be very deep. But in proportion as he advanced, is feet plunged deeper. Soon he had the slime up to his calves and water above is knees. He walked on, raising Marius in his arms, as far above the water as e could. The mire now reached to his knees, and the water to his waist. He ould no longer retreat. This mud, dense enough for one man, could not, bviously, uphold two. Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a chance of xtricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to advance, supporting the ying man, who was, perhaps, a corpse.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.5#The water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; it was only ith difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had now eached. The density, which was his support, was also an obstacle. He still held arius on high, and with an unheard-of expenditure of force, he advanced still; ut he was sinking. He had only his head above the water now and his two arms olding up Marius. In the old paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding er child thus.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.6#He sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape the water, nd in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone who had seen him in that loom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows; e caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of arius; he made a desperate effort and launched his foot forward; his foot truck something solid; a point of support. It was high time.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.6.7#He straightened himself up, and rooted himself upon that point of support ith a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect of the first step in a taircase leading back to life.

Well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness. This ragment of the vaulting, partly submerged, but solid, was a veritable inclined lane, and, once on this plane, he was safe. Jean Valjean mounted this inclined lane and reached the other side of the quagmire.

His assitude was now such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or our steps, and lean against the wall. Once he was forced to seat himself on the anquette in order to alter Marius’ position, and he thought that he should have o remain there. But if his vigor was dead, his energy was not. He rose gain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.7.3#He walked on desperately, almost fast, proceeded thus for a hundred paces, lmost without drawing breath, and suddenly came in contact with the wall. He ad reached an elbow of the sewer, and, arriving at the turn with head bent own, he had struck the wall. He raised his eyes, and at the extremity of the ault, far, very far away in front of him, he perceived a light. This time it as not that terrible light; it was good, white light. It was daylight. Jean aljean saw the outlet.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.7.4#A damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenly perceive he outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt. It would fly ildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal. Jean aljean was no longer conscious of fatigue, he no longer felt Marius’ weight, he ound his legs once more of steel, he ran rather than walked. As he approached, he outlet became more and more distinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, lower han the vault, which gradually narrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which losed in as the vault grew lower. The tunnel ended like the interior of a unnel; a faulty construction, imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries, ogical in a prison, illogical in a sewer, and which has since been orrected.

The keyhole ould be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk in the iron staple. The door as plainly double-locked. It was one of those prison locks which old Paris was o fond of lavishing.

The distant quays, Paris, that gulf in hich one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty. On the right, ownstream, the bridge of Jéna was discernible, on the left, upstream, the ridge of the Invalides; the place would have been a propitious one in which to wait the night and to escape. It was one of the most solitary points in Paris; he shore which faces the Grand-Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging hrough the bars of the grating.

The grating did ot stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after the other, in the hope that he ight be able to tear away the least solid, and to make of it a lever wherewith o raise the door or to break the lock. Not a bar stirred. The teeth of a tiger re not more firmly fixed in their sockets. No lever; no prying possible. The bstacle was invincible. There was no means of opening the gate.

And after the quagmire, was there ot the police patrol, which assuredly could not be twice avoided? And then, hither was he to go? What direction should he pursue? To follow the incline ould not conduct him to his goal. If he were to reach another outlet, he would ind it obstructed by a plug or a grating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly, closed n that manner.

At the physician’s rders, a camp bed had been prepared beside the sofa. The doctor examined arius, and after having found that his pulse was still beating, that the ounded man had no very deep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the orners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the ed, without a pillow, with his head on the same level as his body, and even a rifle lower, and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration. ademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressing Marius, ithdrew. She set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber.

The ong, underground journey had completed the dislocation of the broken ollar-bone, and the disorder there was serious. The arms had been slashed with abre cuts. Not a single scar disfigured his face; but his head was fairly overed with cuts; what would be the result of these wounds on the head? Would hey stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack the brain? As yet, his could not be decided. A grave symptom was that they had caused a swoon, and hat people do not always recover from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded man ad been exhausted by hemorrhage. From the waist down, the barricade had rotected the lower part of the body from injury.

As lint was lacking, the doctor, for the time being, rrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. Beside the bed, three candles urned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out. The octor bathed Marius’ face and hair with cold water. A full pail was reddened in n instant. The porter, candle in hand, lighted them.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.12.11#He stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of the alf-open door, with his head bent a little forward and quivering, his body rapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight and as destitute of folds s a winding-sheet; and he had the air of a phantom who is gazing into a omb.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.12.25#The doctor, who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters, quitted arius for a moment, went to M. Gillenormand, and took his arm. The grandfather urned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemed exaggerated in size and loodshot, and said to him calmly:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.12.26#“I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death of ouis XVI., I know how to bear events. One thing is terrible and that is to hink that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. You will have cribblers, chatterers, lawyers, orators, tribunes, discussions, progress, nlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty of the press, and this is the way hat your children will be brought home to you. Ah! Marius! It is abominable! illed! Dead before me! A barricade! Ah, the scamp! Doctor, you live in this uarter, I believe? Oh! I know you well. I see your cabriolet pass my window. I m going to tell you. You are wrong to think that I am angry. One does not fly nto a rage against a dead man. That would be stupid. This is a child whom I ave reared. I was already old while he was very young. He played in the uileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair, and in order that he inspectors might not grumble, I stopped up the holes that he made in the arth with his shovel, with my cane. One day he exclaimed: Down with Louis VIII.! and off he went. It was no fault of mine. He was all rosy and blond. His other is dead. Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond? Why is t so? He is the son of one of those brigands of the Loire, but children are nnocent of their fathers’ crimes. I remember when he was no higher than that. e could not manage to pronounce his Ds. He had a way of talking that was so weet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping. I emember that once, in front of the Hercules Farnese, people formed a circle to dmire him and marvel at him, he was so handsome, was that child! He had a head uch as you see in pictures. I talked in a deep voice, and I frightened him with y cane, but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh. In the orning, when he entered my room, I grumbled, but he was like the sunlight to e, all the same. One cannot defend oneself against those brats. They take hold f you, they hold you fast, they never let you go again. The truth is, that here never was a cupid like that child. Now, what can you say for your afayettes, your Benjamin Constants, and your Tirecuir de Corcelles who have illed him? This cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.12.27#He approached Marius, who still lay livid and motionless, and to whom the hysician had returned, and began once more to wring his hands. The old man’s allid lips moved as though mechanically, and permitted the passage of words hat were barely audible, like breaths in the death agony:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.3.12.31#“It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.2#He walked with drooping head for the first time in his life, and likewise, or the first time in his life, with his hands behind his back.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.3#Up to that day, Javert had borrowed from Napoleon’s attitudes, only that hich is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across the chest; that which s expressive of uncertainty—with the hands behind the back—had been unknown to im. Now, a change had taken place; his whole person, slow and sombre, was tamped with anxiety.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.4#He plunged into the silent streets.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.5#Nevertheless, he followed one given direction.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.6#He took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes, skirted he quay, passed the Grève, and halted at some distance from the post of the lace du Châtelet, at the angle of the Pont Notre-Dame. There, between the otre-Dame and the Pont au Change on the one hand, and the Quai de la Mégisserie nd the Quai aux Fleurs on the other, the Seine forms a sort of square lake, raversed by a rapid.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.7#This point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is more dangerous han this rapid, hemmed in, at that epoch, and irritated by the piles of the ill on the bridge, now demolished. The two bridges, situated thus close ogether, augment the peril; the water hurries in formidable wise through the rches. It rolls in vast and terrible waves; it accumulates and piles up there; he flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them p with great liquid ropes. Men who fall in there never reappear; the best of wimmers are drowned there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.8#Javert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting in both hands, nd, while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of his whiskers, e meditated.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.9#A novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in the depths f his being; and he had something upon which to examine himself.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.11#For several hours, Javert had ceased to be simple. He was troubled; that rain, so limpid in its blindness, had lost its transparency; that crystal was louded. Javert felt duty divided within his conscience, and he could not onceal the fact from himself. When he had so unexpectedly encountered Jean aljean on the banks of the Seine, there had been in him something of the wolf hich regains his grip on his prey, and of the dog who finds his master gain.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.12#He beheld before him two paths, both equally straight, but he beheld two; nd that terrified him; him, who had never in all his life known more than one traight line. And, the poignant anguish lay in this, that the two paths were ontrary to each other. One of these straight lines excluded the other. Which of he two was the true one?

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.14#To owe his life to a malefactor, to accept that debt and to repay it; to e, in spite of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice, and to repay is service with another service; to allow it to be said to him, “Go,” and to ay to the latter in his turn: “Be free”; to sacrifice to personal motives duty, hat general obligation, and to be conscious, in those personal motives, of omething that was also general, and, perchance, superior, to betray society in rder to remain true to his conscience; that all these absurdities should be ealized and should accumulate upon him,—this was what overwhelmed him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.15#One thing had amazed him,—this was that Jean Valjean should have done him favor, and one thing petrified him,—that he, Javert, should have done Jean aljean a favor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.16#Where did he stand? He sought to comprehend his position, and could no onger find his bearings.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.17#What was he to do now? To deliver up Jean Valjean was bad; to leave Jean aljean at liberty was bad. In the first case, the man of authority fell lower han the man of the galleys, in the second, a convict rose above the law, and et his foot upon it. In both cases, dishonor for him, Javert. There was isgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive. Destiny has some xtremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible, and beyond which ife is no longer anything but a precipice. Javert had reached one of those xtremities.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.18#One of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think. The very iolence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. Thought was omething to which he was unused, and which was peculiarly painful.

Nevertheless, it was indispensable hat he should take a look into his conscience, after such shocks, and render to imself an account of himself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.4.1.21#What he had just done made him shudder. He, Javert, had seen fit to ecide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to the whole ocial and judicial organization, contrary to the entire code, upon a release; his had suited him; he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the ublic; was not this unjustifiable? Every time that he brought himself face to ace with this deed without a name which he had committed, he trembled from head o foot. Upon what should he decide? One sole resource remained to him; to eturn in all haste to the Rue de l’Homme Armé, and commit Jean Valjean to rison. It was clear that that was what he ought to do. He could not.

What then! such enormities were to happen and no one as to be punished! Jean Valjean, stronger than the whole social order, was to emain at liberty, and he, Javert, was to go on eating the government’s read!

Jean Valjean’s generosity towards him, Javert, crushed him. Other facts hich he now recalled, and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly, now ecurred to him as realities. M. Madeleine reappeared behind Jean Valjean, and he two figures were superposed in such fashion that they now formed but one, hich was venerable. Javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his oul—admiration for a convict. Respect for a galley-slave—is that a possible hing? He shuddered at it, yet could not escape from it. In vain did he truggle, he was reduced to confess, in his inmost heart, the sublimity of that retch. This was odious.

Twenty times, as he sat in that arriage face to face with Jean Valjean, the legal tiger had roared within him. score of times he had been tempted to fling himself upon Jean Valjean, to eize him and devour him, that is to say, to arrest him. What more simple, in act? To cry out at the first post that they passed:—“Here is a fugitive from ustice, who has broken his ban!” to summon the gendarmes and say to them: “This an is yours!” then to go off, leaving that condemned man there, to ignore the est and not to meddle further in the matter. This man is forever a prisoner of he law; the law may do with him what it will. What could be more just? Javert ad said all this to himself; he had wished to pass beyond, to act, to apprehend he man, and then, as at present, he had not been able to do it; and every time hat his arm had been raised convulsively towards Jean Valjean’s collar, his and had fallen back again, as beneath an enormous weight, and in the depths of is thought he had heard a voice, a strange voice crying to him:—“It is well. eliver up your savior.

He had o deal with scruples of an unknown species. There had taken place within him a entimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation, his only tandard of measurement hitherto. To remain in his former uprightness did not uffice. A whole order of unexpected facts had cropped up and subjugated him. A hole new world was dawning on his soul: kindness accepted and repaid, devotion, ercy, indulgence, violences committed by pity on austerity, respect for ersons, no more definitive condemnation, no more conviction, the possibility of tear in the eye of the law, no one knows what justice according to God, unning in inverse sense to justice according to men.

So there is something beyond duty?” Here he took fright; his alance became disjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss, the other rose eavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than y the one which was below. Without being in the least in the world what is alled Voltairian or a philosopher, or incredulous, being, on the contrary, espectful by instinct, towards the established church, he knew it only as an ugust fragment of the social whole; order was his dogma, and sufficed for him; ver since he had attained to man’s estate and the rank of a functionary, he had entred nearly all his religion in the police.

Truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him, inexorably. enceforth, he must be a different man. He was suffering from the strange pains f a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract. He saw that which it was epugnant to him to behold.

This table, still ompleted by its straw-seated chair, is an institution; it exists in all police tations; it is invariably ornamented with a box-wood saucer filled with sawdust nd a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers, and it forms the lowest tage of official style.

An order of nolle prosequi_, founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the vening of the ambush, had set him at liberty. He had taken to his heels. He had eturned to his road from Gagny to Lagny, to make, under administrative upervision, broken stone for the good of the state, with downcast mien, in a ery pensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but he was addicted onetheless tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him.

This man did not belong n the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot, evidently. No public onveyance passes through Montfermeil at that hour. He had walked all night. hence came he? Not from a very great distance; for he had neither haversack, or bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why was he in these woods? why was he there at uch an hour? what had he come there for?

Footprints stamped in the sand, eeds trodden down here and there, heather crushed, young branches in the rushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up again with the raceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who stretches herself when he wakes, pointed out to him a sort of track. He followed it, then lost it. ime was flying. He plunged deeper into the woods and came to a sort of minence. An early huntsman who was passing in the distance along a path, histling the air of Guillery, suggested to him the idea of climbing a tree. Old s he was, he was agile.

This glade was the one which was formerly called the Blaru-bottom. The eap of stones, destined for no one knows what employment, which was visible here thirty years ago, is doubtless still there.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.1#For a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive. For many weeks he lay n a fever accompanied by delirium, and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms, aused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by the wounds hemselves.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.2#He repeated Cosette’s name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity of ever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some of the lesions resented a serious danger, the suppuration of large wounds being always liable o become re-absorbed, and consequently, to kill the sick man, under certain tmospheric conditions; at every change of weather, at the slightest storm, the hysician was uneasy.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.3#“Above all things,” he repeated, “let the wounded man be subjected to no motion.” The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult, the fixation f apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been invented as yet, at that poch. Nicolette used up a sheet “as big as the ceiling,” as she put it, for int. It was not without difficulty that the chloruretted lotions and the itrate of silver overcame the gangrene. As long as there was any danger, M. illenormand, seated in despair at his grandson’s pillow, was, like Marius, either alive nor dead.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.4#Every day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman with white air,—such was the description given by the porter,—came to inquire about the ounded man, and left a large package of lint for the dressings.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.5#Finally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after the sorrowful ight when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition, the octor declared that he would answer for Marius. Convalescence began. But Marius as forced to remain for two months more stretched out on a long chair, on ccount of the results called up by the fracture of his collar-bone. There lways is a last wound like that which will not close, and which prolongs the ressings indefinitely, to the great annoyance of the sick person.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.6#However, this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from all ursuit. In France, there is no wrath, not even of a public character, which six onths will not extinguish. Revolts, in the present state of society, are so uch the fault of every one, that they are followed by a certain necessity of hutting the eyes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.7#Let us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined doctors to odge information against the wounded, having outraged public opinion, and not pinion alone, but the King first of all, the wounded were covered and protected y this indignation; and, with the exception of those who had been made risoners in the very act of combat, the councils of war did not dare to trouble ny one. So Marius was left in peace.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.8#M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and then hrough every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent his passing very night beside the wounded man; he had his big armchair carried to Marius’ edside; he required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for ompresses and bandages. Mademoiselle Gillenormand, like a sage and elderly erson, contrived to spare the fine linen, while allowing the grandfather to hink that he was obeyed. M. Gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to im, that for the preparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse inen, nor new linen as old linen. He was present at all the dressings of the ounds from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself. When the ead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said: “Aïe! aïe!” Nothing was more ouching than to see him with his gentle, senile palsy, offer the wounded man a up of his cooling-draught. He overwhelmed the doctor with questions. He did not bserve that he asked the same ones over and over again.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.9#On the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out of danger, he good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present of three louis. hat evening, on his return to his own chamber, he danced a gavotte, using his humb and forefinger as castanets, and he sang the following song:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.13#Up to that time, he had not believed in God.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.14#At each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more and more ronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of mechanical actions ull of joy; he ascended and descended the stairs, without knowing why. A pretty emale neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a big bouquet; it was M. illenormand who had sent it to her. The husband made a jealous scene. M. illenormand tried to draw Nicolette upon his knees. He called Marius, “M. le aron.” He shouted: “Long live the Republic!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.15#Every moment, he kept asking the doctor: “Is he no longer in danger?” He azed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over him while he te. He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered himself an account of imself. Marius was the master of the house, there was abdication in his joy, he as the grandson of his grandson.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.16#In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable of hildren. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent, he tepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted, charming, young. is white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage. When race is mingled with wrinkles, it is adorable. There is an indescribable aurora n beaming old age.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.17#As for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him, he ad but one fixed idea: Cosette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.18#After the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again pronounce her ame, and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of her. He held is peace, precisely because his soul was there.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.19#He did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of the Rue de a Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows that were almost ndistinct, floated through his mind, Éponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf, the hénardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of the arricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through that adventure roduced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; he understood nothing onnected with his own life, he did not know how nor by whom he had been saved, nd no one of those around him knew this; all that they had been able to tell im was, that he had been brought home at night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue es Filles-du-Calvaire; past, present, future were nothing more to him than the ist of a vague idea; but in that fog there was one immovable point, one clear nd precise outline, something made of granite, a resolution, a will; to find osette once more. For him, the idea of life was not distinct from the idea of osette. He had decreed in his heart that he would not accept the one without he other, and he was immovably resolved to exact of any person whatever, who hould desire to force him to live,—from his grandfather, from fate, from ell,—the restitution of his vanished Eden.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.20#He did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.21#Let us here emphasize one detail, he was not won over and was but little oftened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather. In the first lace, he was not in the secret; then, in his reveries of an invalid, which were till feverish, possibly, he distrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel hing, which had for its object his conquest. He remained cold. The grandfather bsolutely wasted his poor old smile. Marius said to himself that it was all ight so long as he, Marius, did not speak, and let things take their course; ut that when it became a question of Cosette, he would find another face, and hat his grandfather’s true attitude would be unmasked. Then there would be an npleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions, a confrontation of ositions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the ame time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about his neck, he future. Violent resistance; conclusion: a refusal. Marius stiffened himself n advance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.22#And then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers of his memory pened once more, he reflected again on the past, Colonel Pontmercy placed imself once more between M. Gillenormand and him, Marius, he told himself that e had no true kindness to expect from a person who had been so unjust and so ard to his father. And with health, there returned to him a sort of harshness owards his grandfather. The old man was gently pained by this. M. Gillenormand, ithout however allowing it to appear, observed that Marius, ever since the atter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness, had not once alled him father. It is true that he did not say “monsieur” to him; but he ontrived not to say either the one or the other, by means of a certain way of urning his phrases. Obviously, a crisis was approaching.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.23#As almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before giving attle, by way of proving himself. This is called “feeling the ground.” One orning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly of the onvention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands, and gave ent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste and Robespierre.—“The men of 93 were giants,” said Marius with severity. The old man held his peace, and ttered not a sound during the remainder of that day.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.24#Marius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of is early years, interpreted this silence as a profound concentration of wrath, ugured from it a hot conflict, and augmented his preparations for the fray in he inmost recesses of his mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.25#He decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his bandages, islocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds which he had eft, and would reject all food. His wounds were his munitions of war. He would ave Cosette or die.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.2.26#He awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick.

A fried sole is excellent to begin a onvalescence with, but a good cutlet is needed to put a sick man on his eet.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.3.2#Marius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collected the whole f it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, laid his two clenched fists on he sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in the face, assumed a terrible ir, and said:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.5.1#The reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating a lengthy xplanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had been able, hanks to his first escape of a few days’ duration, to come to Paris and to ithdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, the sum earned by him, under the ame of Monsieur Madeleine, at Montreuil-sur-Mer; and that fearing that he might e recaptured,—which eventually happened—he had buried and hidden that sum in he forest of Montfermeil, in the locality known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum, ix hundred and thirty thousand francs, all in bank-bills, was not very bulky, nd was contained in a box; only, in order to preserve the box from dampness, he ad placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings. In the same coffer he ad placed his other treasures, the Bishop’s candlesticks. It will be remembered hat he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape from ontreuil-sur-Mer. The man seen one evening for the first time by Boulatruelle, as Jean Valjean. Later on, every time that Jean Valjean needed money, he went o get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have mentioned. He ad a pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place known to himself lone. When he beheld Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour was at hand, hen that money might prove of service, he had gone to get it; it was he again, hom Boulatruelle had seen in the woods, but on this occasion, in the morning nstead of in the evening. Boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.5.2#The actual sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand, five hundred rancs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.—“We shall see ereafter,” he thought.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.5.3#The difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand rancs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years, from 823 to 1833. The five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five housand francs.

If he ere to announce her origin bluntly, it might prevent the marriage, who knows? e extricated Cosette from all difficulties. He concocted for her a family of ead people, a sure means of not encountering any objections. Cosette was the nly scion of an extinct family; Cosette was not his own daughter, but the aughter of the other Fauchelevent. Two brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners o the convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent; the very est information and the most respectable references abounded; the good nuns, ot very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity, and not ttaching any importance to the matter, had never understood exactly of which of he two Fauchelevents Cosette was the daughter. They said what was wanted and hey said it with zeal. An _acte de notoriété_ was drawn up. Cosette became in he eyes of the law, Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent. She was declared an rphan, both father and mother being dead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he as appointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette’s guardian, with M. illenormand as supervising guardian over him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.6.9#As for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituted a egacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to remain unknown. he original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety-four thousand rancs; but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of ademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to he convent. This legacy, deposited in the hands of a third party, was to be urned over to Cosette at her majority, or at the date of her marriage. This, aken as a whole, was very acceptable, as the reader will perceive, especially hen the sum due was half a million. There were some peculiarities here and here, it is true, but they were not noticed; one of the interested parties had is eyes blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred thousand francs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.6.10#Cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had o long called father. He was merely a kinsman; another Fauchelevent was her eal father. At any other time this would have broken her heart. But at the neffable moment which she was then passing through, it cast but a slight hadow, a faint cloud, and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last ong. She had Marius. The young man arrived, the old man was effaced; such is ife.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.6.11#And then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to seeing enigmas round her; every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared or certain renunciations.

While ean Valjean was building up for Cosette a normal situation in society and an nassailable status, M. Gillenormand was superintending the basket of wedding ifts. Nothing so amused him as being magnificent. He had given to Cosette a obe of Binche guipure which had descended to him from his own grandmother.

Pekins, damasks, lampas, painted oires, robes of shot gros de Tours, India kerchiefs embroidered in gold that ould be washed, dauphines without a right or wrong side, in the piece, Genoa nd Alençon point lace, parures in antique goldsmith’s work, ivory bon-bon boxes rnamented with microscopic battles, gewgaws and ribbons—he lavished everything n Cosette. Cosette, amazed, desperately in love with Marius, and wild with ratitude towards M. Gillenormand, dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed n satin and velvet.

Happiness is only the necessary. eason that enormously with the superfluous for me. A palace and her heart. Her eart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand waterworks of Versailles. Give me y shepherdess and try to make her a duchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned with orn-flowers, and add a hundred thousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic erspective as far as you can see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the ucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness esembles dry bread. One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, he useless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. I remember o have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall as a three-story ouse which marked the hours, which had the kindness to indicate the hour, but hich had not the air of being made for that; and which, after having struck idday, or midnight,—midday, the hour of the sun, or midnight, the hour of ove,—or any other hour that you like, gave you the moon and the stars, the arth and the sea, birds and fishes, Phœbus and Phœbe, and a host of things hich emerged from a niche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the ifth, and Éponine, and Sabinus, and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who layed on the trumpet to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it prinkled through the air, on every occasion, without any one’s knowing why. Is petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to that? For my part, am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg, and I prefer it to the cuckoo lock from the Black Forest.”

You do not know how to organize day of enjoyment in this age,” he exclaimed. “Your nineteenth century is weak. t lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it ignores the noble. In everything it is lean-shaven. Your third estate is insipid, colorless, odorless, and shapeless. he dreams of your bourgeois who set up, as they express it: a pretty boudoir reshly decorated, violet, ebony and calico. Make way! Make way! the Sieur urmudgeon is marrying Mademoiselle Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness and splendor. A ouis d’or has been stuck to a candle. There’s the epoch for you. My demand is hat I may flee from it beyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict that all as lost, from the day when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Léon, Duc de habot, Duc de Montbazon, Marquis de Soubise, Vicomte de Thouars, peer of rance, go to Longchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits. In this entury, men attend to business, they gamble on ‘Change, they win money, they re stingy. People take care of their surfaces and varnish them; every one is ressed as though just out of a bandbox, washed, soaped, scraped, shaved, ombed, waked, smoothed, rubbed, brushed, cleaned on the outside, rreproachable, polished as a pebble, discreet, neat, and at the same time, eath of my life, in the depths of their consciences they have dung-heaps and esspools that are enough to make a cow-herd who blows his nose in his fingers, ecoil. I grant to this age the device: ‘Dirty Cleanliness.’ Don’t be vexed, arius, give me permission to speak; I say no evil of the people as you see, I m always harping on your people, but do look favorably on my dealing a bit of a lap to the bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well lashes well. hereupon, I say plainly, that nowadays people marry, but that they no longer now how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of the ancient manners. I egret everything about them, their elegance, their chivalry, those courteous nd delicate ways, that joyous luxury which every one possessed, music forming art of the wedding, a symphony above stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, he dances, the joyous faces round the table, the fine-spun gallant compliments, he songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, the devil’s own row, the huge nots of ribbon. I regret the bride’s garter. The bride’s garter is cousin to he girdle of Venus. On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen’s garter, arbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break over the head of eriones that great brazen helmet of ten points? why did Achilles and Hector hew ach other up with vast blows of their lances? Because Helen allowed Paris to ake her garter. With Cosette’s garter, Homer would construct the _Iliad_. He ould put in his poem, a loquacious old fellow, like me, and he would call him estor. My friends, in bygone days, in those amiable days of yore, people arried wisely; they had a good contract, and then they had a good carouse. As oon as Cujas had taken his departure, Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! the tomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants to have its edding also. People supped well, and had at table a beautiful neighbor without guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed. Oh! the large aughing mouths, and how gay we were in those days! youth was a bouquet; every oung man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft of roses; whether he was a hepherd or a warrior; and if, by chance, one was a captain of dragoons, one ound means to call oneself Florian. People thought much of looking well. They mbroidered and tinted themselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a arquis had the air of a precious stone. People had no straps to their boots, hey had no boots. They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, ainty, coquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their ides. The humming-bird has beak and claws. That was the day of the _Galland ndies_. One of the sides of that century was delicate, the other was agnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves. To-day, people re serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise is a prude; your entury is unfortunate. People would drive away the Graces as being too low in he neck. Alas! beauty is concealed as though it were ugliness. Since the evolution, everything, including the ballet-dancers, has had its trousers; a ountebank dancer must be grave; your rigadoons are doctrinarian. It is ecessary to be majestic. People would be greatly annoyed if they did not carry heir chins in their cravats. The ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries, s to resemble M. Royer-Collard. And do you know what one arrives at with that ajesty? at being petty. Learn this: joy is not only joyous; it is great. But be n love gayly then, what the deuce! marry, when you marry, with fever and iddiness, and tumult, and the uproar of happiness! Be grave in church, well and ood. But, as soon as the mass is finished, sarpejou! you must make a dream hirl around the bride. A marriage should be royal and chimerical; it should romenade its ceremony from the cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. have a horror of a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that one ay, at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Games and aughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every recently made ridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. Profit by that unique minute in life o soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles, even if you do have o fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of the frogs. Don’t economize on he nuptials, do not prune them of their splendors; don’t scrimp on the day when ou beam. The wedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my ancy, it would be gallant, violins would be heard under the trees. Here is my rogramme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival the rural ivinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The nuptials of mphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked, an cademician offering quatrains to the goddess, a chariot drawn by marine onsters.

He had the eiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, which he had by him in the iece, and which he believed to have emanated from Utrecht with a uttercup-colored satin ground, covered with velvet auricula blossoms.—“It was ith that stuff,” said he, “that the bed of the Duchesse d’Anville at la oche-Guyon was draped.”—On the chimney-piece, he set a little figure in Saxe orcelain, carrying a muff against her nude stomach.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.1#The lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M. auchelevent.—“This is reversing things,” said Mademoiselle Gillenormand, “to ave the bride come to the house to do the courting like this.” But Marius’ onvalescence had caused the habit to become established, and the armchairs of he Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, better adapted to interviews than the straw hairs of the Rue de l’Homme Armé, had rooted it. Marius and M. Fauchelevent saw ach other, but did not address each other. It seemed as though this had been greed upon. Every girl needs a chaperon. Cosette could not have come without M. auchelevent. In Marius’ eyes, M. Fauchelevent was the condition attached to osette. He accepted it. By dint of discussing political matters, vaguely and ithout precision, from the point of view of the general amelioration of the ate of all men, they came to say a little more than “yes” and “no.” Once, on he subject of education, which Marius wished to have free and obligatory, ultiplied under all forms lavished on every one, like the air and the sun in a ord, respirable for the entire population, they were in unison, and they almost onversed. M. Fauchelevent talked well, and even with a certain loftiness of anguage—still he lacked something indescribable. M. Fauchelevent possessed omething less and also something more, than a man of the world.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.2#Marius, inwardly, and in the depths of his thought, surrounded with all orts of mute questions this M. Fauchelevent, who was to him simply benevolent nd cold. There were moments when doubts as to his own recollections occurred to im. There was a void in his memory, a black spot, an abyss excavated by four onths of agony.—Many things had been lost therein. He had come to the point of sking himself whether it were really a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, o serious and so calm a man, in the barricade.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.3#This was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions and the isappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must not be supposed that he as delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which force us, even when appy, even when satisfied, to glance sadly behind us. The head which does not urn backwards towards horizons that have vanished contains neither thought nor ove. At times, Marius clasped his face between his hands, and the vague and umultuous past traversed the twilight which reigned in his brain. Again he eheld Mabeuf fall, he heard Gavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt eneath his lips the cold brow of Éponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, ombeferre, Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect before him, then ispersed into thin air. Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or ragic beings merely dreams? had they actually existed? The revolt had enveloped verything in its smoke. These great fevers create great dreams. He questioned imself; he felt himself; all these vanished realities made him dizzy. Where ere they all then? was it really true that all were dead? A fall into the hadows had carried off all except himself. It all seemed to him to have isappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre. There are curtains like his which drop in life. God passes on to the following act.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.4#And he himself—was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, was rich; e, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, was to marry Cosette. It eemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, and that he had entered into it lack and had emerged from it white, and in that tomb the others had remained. t certain moments, all these beings of the past, returned and present, formed a ircle around him, and overshadowed him; then he thought of Cosette, and ecovered his serenity; but nothing less than this felicity could have sufficed o efface that catastrophe.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.5#M. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings. Marius esitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade was the same as this auchelevent in flesh and blood, sitting so gravely beside Cosette. The first as, probably, one of those nightmares occasioned and brought back by his hours f delirium. However, the natures of both men were rigid, no question from arius to M. Fauchelevent was possible. Such an idea had not even occurred to im. We have already indicated this characteristic detail.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.6#Two men who have a secret in common, and who, by a sort of tacit agreement, xchange not a word on the subject, are less rare than is commonly supposed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.7#Once only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into the conversation he Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent, he said to him:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.8#“Of course, you are acquainted with that street?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.9#“What street?”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.11#“I have no idea of the name of that street,” replied M. Fauchelevent, in he most natural manner in the world.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.12#The response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the treet itself, appeared to Marius to be more conclusive than it really was.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.7.13#“Decidedly,” thought he, “I have been dreaming. I have been subject to a allucination. It was some one who resembled him. M. Fauchelevent was not here.”’

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.5.8.9#None of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in discovering ny trace of Thénardier. Obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter. adame Thénardier had died in prison pending the trial. Thénardier and his aughter Azelma, the only two remaining of that lamentable group, had plunged ack into the gloom. The gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above hose beings. On the surface there was not visible so much as that quiver, that rembling, those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has allen in, and that the plummet may be dropped.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.6.1.4#The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. France had ot yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying off one’s wife, f fleeing, on coming out of church, of hiding oneself with shame from one’s appiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the Song f Songs. People had not yet grasped to the full the chastity, exquisiteness, nd decency of jolting their paradise in a posting-chaise, of breaking up their ystery with clic-clacs, of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn, and of eaving behind them, in a commonplace chamber, at so much a night, the most acred of the souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the tête-à-tête of the onductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of the inn.

France does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like he English nobility, and raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a ail storm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn-out shoes, in memory of hurchill, afterwards Marlborough, or Malbrouck, who was assailed on his edding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.6.1.24#At that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in rocess of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue du Parc-Royal. It as impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to Saint-Paul. They were bliged to alter their course, and the simplest way was to turn through the oulevard. One of the invited guests observed that it was Shrove Tuesday, and hat there would be a jam of vehicles.—“Why?” asked M. Gillenormand—“Because of he maskers.”—“Capital,” said the grandfather, “let us go that way. These young olks are on the way to be married; they are about to enter the serious part of ife. This will prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.6.1.25#They went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosette nd Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. Marius, still separated rom his betrothed according to usage, did not come until the second. The uptial train, on emerging from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, became entangled n a long procession of vehicles which formed an endless chain from the adeleine to the Bastille, and from the Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers bounded on the boulevard. In spite of the fact that it was raining at ntervals, Merry-Andrew, Pantaloon and Clown persisted. In the good humor of hat winter of 1833, Paris had disguised itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays re no longer to be seen nowadays. Everything which exists being a scattered arnival, there is no longer any Carnival.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.6.1.26#The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with urious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the theatres were ordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they stared at that rocession—peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps,—of vehicles of every escription, citadines, tapissières, carioles, cabriolets marching in order, igorously riveted to each other by the police regulations, and locked into ails, as it were. Any one in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a pectacle. Police sergeants maintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two nterminable parallel files, moving in contrary directions, and saw to it that othing interfered with that double current, those two brooks of carriages, lowing, the one downstream, the other upstream, the one towards the Chaussée ’Antin, the other towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The carriages of the eers of France and of the Ambassadors, emblazoned with coats of arms, held the iddle of the way, going and coming freely. Certain joyous and magnificent rains, notably that of the Bœuf Gras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of aris, England cracked her whip; Lord Seymour’s post-chaise, harassed by a ickname from the populace, passed with great noise.

Twenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six. They ling to the seats, to the rumble, on the cheeks of the hood, on the shafts. hey even bestride the carriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their knees rawn up in a knot, and their legs hanging. The women sit on the men’s laps. Far way, above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is visible. These arriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout. Collé, Panard nd Piron flow from it, enriched with slang. This carriage which has become olossal through its freight, has an air of conquest. Uproar reigns in front, umult behind. People vociferate, shout, howl, there they break forth and writhe ith enjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm flames forth, joviality is flaunted like a ed flag; two jades there drag farce blossomed forth into an apotheosis; it is he triumphal car of laughter.

Listen o me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each other. I do not make a pack f gyrations, I go straight to the mark, be happy. In all creation, only the urtledoves are wise. Philosophers say: ‘Moderate your joys.’ I say: ‘Give rein o your joys.’ Be as much smitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about t. The philosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff their hilosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes, too many pen rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much urora in life? can people love each other too much? can people please each ther too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too pretty! Have a care, Nemorin, hou art too handsome! Fine stupidity, in sooth! Can people enchant each other oo much, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much? Can one be too uch alive, too happy? Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the hilosophers! Wisdom consists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are e happy because we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy iamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, or because it eighs six hundred carats? I know nothing about it, life is full of such roblems; the important point is to possess the Sancy and happiness. Let us be appy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obey the sun blindly. What is the un? It is love. He who says love, says woman. Ah! ah! behold omnipotence—women. sk that demagogue of a Marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a osette. And of his own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no obespierre who keeps his place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except owards that royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No ’89 for Eve. There as been the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been the mperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre of harlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis the Great, hich was of gold,—the revolution twisted them between its thumb and forefinger, a’penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, it lies on the earth, there is o longer any sceptre, but make me a revolution against that little embroidered andkerchief, which smells of patchouli! I should like to see you do it. Try. hy is it so solid? Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? ell, what then? And we have been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that you ave effected much change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called he cholera-morbus, and because your _pourrée_ is called the cachuca. In fact, he women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. These friends re our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle from which I defy you o escape; and, for my own part, I should be only too happy to re-enter it. hich of you has seen the planet Venus, the coquette of the abyss, the Célimène f the ocean, rise in the infinite, calming all here below? The ocean is a rough lcestis. Well, grumble as he will, when Venus appears he is forced to smile. hat brute beast submits. We are all made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, oam to the very ceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on our face! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married. That is ell. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist boldly for each ther, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same, idealize each other, atch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist on earth, and rrange yourselves a nest for life. Pardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine iracle when one is young! Don’t imagine that you have invented that. I, too, ave had my dream, I, too, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had moonlight soul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to long white beard. Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid. For sixty enturies men and women have got out of their scrape by loving. The devil, who s cunning, took to hating man; man, who is still more cunning, took to loving oman. In this way he does more good than the devil does him harm. This craft as discovered in the days of the terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my riends, but it is perfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while aiting to become Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with each ther, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sun for arius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let your fine eather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain be your wife’s ears. And let it never rain in your household. You have filched the winning umber in the lottery; you have gained the great prize, guard it well, keep it nder lock and key, do not squander it, adore each other and snap your fingers t all the rest. Believe what I say to you. It is good sense. And good sense annot lie. Be a religion to each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring od. Saperlotte! the best way to adore God is to love one’s wife. _I love thee!_ hat’s my catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. places anctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I don’t elong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it. This astonishes e on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I am old, they say; t’s astonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young. I should like to go nd listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive to be beautiful nd contented,—that intoxicates me. I would like greatly to get married, if any ne would have me. It is impossible to imagine that God could have made us for nything but this: to idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to e dainty, to bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one’s image n one’s little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that is he aim of life. There, let not that displease you which we used to think in our ay, when we were young folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what charming women there ere in those days, and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses! I ommitted my ravages among them. Then love each other. If people did not love ach other, I really do not see what use there would be in having any pringtime; and for my own part, I should pray the good God to shut up all the eautiful things that he shows us, and to take away from us and put back in his ox, the flowers, the birds, and the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old an’s blessing.”

Where true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the deal enters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. If it were iven to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the pper life, it is probable that we should behold the forms of night, the winged nknowns, the blue passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre eads, around the luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing ut to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing he reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances.

There were no sheets on the bed. he pillow, covered with ticking, and without a case or lace, was laid on the lankets folded up on the foot of the mattress, whose covering was visible, and n which no one was ever to sleep again. All the little feminine objects which osette was attached to had been carried away; nothing remained except the heavy urniture and the four walls. Toussaint’s bed was despoiled in like manner.

All this was black of hue. It was he who had rought those garments to Montfermeil for her. As he removed them from the alise, he laid them on the bed. He fell to thinking. He called up memories. It as in winter, in a very cold month of December, she was shivering, half-naked, n rags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes. He, Jean aljean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these mourning abiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, to see her daughter earing mourning for her, and, above all, to see that she was properly clothed, nd that she was warm. He thought of that forest of Montfermeil; they had raversed it together, Cosette and he; he thought of what the weather had been, f the leafless trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it attered not, it was charming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the ichu next to the petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at hem, one after the other. She was no taller than that, she had her big doll in er arms, she had put her louis d’or in the pocket of that apron, she had aughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no one in the world but him.

There he remained for welve hours, the twelve long hours of a long winter’s night, ice-cold, without nce raising his head, and without uttering a word. He was as motionless as a orpse, while his thoughts wallowed on the earth and soared, now like the hydra, ow like the eagle. Any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced im dead; all at once he shuddered convulsively, and his mouth, glued to osette’s garments, kissed them; then it could be seen that he was alive.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.1#The days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the meditations f the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some degree. The tumult of isits and congratulations only begins later on. On the morning of the 17th of ebruary, it was a little past midday when Basque, with napkin and eather-duster under his arm, busy in setting his antechamber to rights, heard a ight tap at the door. There had been no ring, which was discreet on such a day. asque opened the door, and beheld M. Fauchelevent. He introduced him into the rawing-room, still encumbered and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a ield of battle after the joys of the preceding evening.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.2#“_Dame_, sir,” remarked Basque, “we all woke up late.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.3#“Is your master up?” asked Jean Valjean.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.5#“Better. Is your master up?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.6#“Which one? the old one or the new one?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.7#“Monsieur Pontmercy.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.8#“Monsieur le Baron,” said Basque, drawing himself up.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.9#A man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for something with hem; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the title, and hat flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militant republican as he ad proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself. A small revolution had taken lace in the family in connection with this title. It was now M. Gillenormand ho clung to it, and Marius who detached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy ad written: “My son will bear my title.” Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in hom the woman was beginning to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.10#“Monsieur le Baron?” repeated Basque. “I will go and see. I will tell him hat M. Fauchelevent is here.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.11#“No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes to speak o him in private, and mention no name.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.12#“Ah!” ejaculated Basque.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.14#“Ah!” ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second “ah!” as an xplanation of the first.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.15#And he left the room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.16#Jean Valjean remained alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.17#The drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. It seemed s though, by lending an ear, one might still hear the vague noise of the edding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from arlands and head-dresses. The wax candles, burned to stumps, added stalactites f wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture as in its place. In the corners, three or four armchairs, drawn close together n a circle, had the appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect as cheerful. A certain grace still lingers round a dead feast. It has been a appy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers, beneath hose extinct lights, people have thought of joy. The sun had succeeded to the handelier, and made its way gayly into the drawing-room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.18#Several minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot where asque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, and so sunken in is head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits. His lack coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night. The lbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen eaves behind it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.19#Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his eet by the sun.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.21#Marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable ight on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. He had not lept either.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.22#“It is you, father!” he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean; that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come too early. t is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.23#That word: “Father,” said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified: supreme elicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a lofty wall, a oldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be broken or melted. arius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered, when he ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent was to him, as to Cosette, a ather.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.24#He continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divine aroxysms of joy.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.27#“We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you so dearly! You ust not forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more to do with he Rue de l’Homme Armé. We will have no more of it at all. How could you go to ive in a street like that, which is sickly, which is disagreeable, which is gly, which has a barrier at one end, where one is cold, and into which one annot enter? You are to come and install yourself here. And this very day. Or ou will have to deal with Cosette. She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn ou. You have your own chamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the arden; the trouble with the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is ll ready, you have only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette has laced a huge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said to t: ‘Stretch out your arms to him.’ A nightingale comes to the clump of acacias pposite your windows, every spring. In two months more you will have it. You ill have its nest on your left and ours on your right. By night it will sing, nd by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber faces due South. Cosette will rrange your books for you, your Voyages of Captain Cook and the ther,—Vancouver’s and all your affairs. I believe that there is a little valise o which you are attached, I have fixed upon a corner of honor for that. You ave conquered my grandfather, you suit him. We will live together. Do you play hist? you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whist. It is ou who shall take Cosette to walk on the days when I am at the courts, you hall give her your arm, you know, as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are bsolutely resolved to be happy. And you shall be included in it, in our appiness, do you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.28#“Sir,” said Jean Valjean, “I have something to say to you. I am an x-convict.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.29#The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well in the ase of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: “I am an ex-convict,” roceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering the ear of Marius vershot the possible. It seemed to him that something had just been said to im; but he did not know what. He stood with his mouth wide open.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.30#Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful. holly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that moment, bserved the other man’s terrible pallor.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.31#Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm, nrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it to arius.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.37#“It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. I absented yself as much as was in my power.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.38#Marius stammered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.39#“What is the meaning of this?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.40#“The meaning of it is,” replied Jean Valjean, “that I have been in the alleys.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.41#“You are driving me mad!” exclaimed Marius in terror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.42#“Monsieur Pontmercy,” said Jean Valjean, “I was nineteen years in the alleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a second ffence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.43#In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resist the vidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and, as always appens in such cases, he understood too much. An inward shudder of hideous nlightenment flashed through him; an idea which made him quiver traversed his ind. He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.44#“Say all, say all!” he cried. “You are Cosette’s father!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.45#And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable orror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.46#Jean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he eemed to grow even to the ceiling.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.47#“It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our oath o others may not be received in law . . .”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.48#Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority, e added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the syllables:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.49#“. . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no. onsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.50#Marius stammered:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.52#“I. Since I tell you so.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.53#Marius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie could roceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. The truth could be felt n that chill of the tomb.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.54#“I believe you,” said Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.55#Jean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, and ontinued:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.56#“What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know that she as in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom one has seen hen very young, being old oneself. When one is old, one feels oneself a randfather towards all little children. You may, it seems to me, suppose that I ave something which resembles a heart. She was an orphan. Without either father r mother. She needed me. That is why I began to love her. Children are so weak hat the first comer, even a man like me, can become their protector. I have ulfilled this duty towards Cosette. I do not think that so slight a thing can e called a good action; but if it be a good action, well, say that I have done t. Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes out of my ife; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for her. She is Madame ontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by the change. All is ell. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do not mention them to me, but forestall your thought, they are a deposit. How did that deposit come into my ands? What does that matter? I restore the deposit. Nothing more can be emanded of me. I complete the restitution by announcing my true name. That oncerns me. I have a reason for desiring that you should know who I am.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.57#And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.58#All that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. Certain gusts f destiny produce these billows in our souls.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.59#We have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is ispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which are not always recisely those which should be said. There are sudden revelations which one annot bear, and which intoxicate like baleful wine. Marius was stupefied by the ovel situation which presented itself to him, to the point of addressing that an almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.60#“But why,” he exclaimed, “do you tell me all this? Who forces you to do o? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither denounced, nor racked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation. onclude. There is something more. In what connection do you make this onfession? What is your motive?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.61#“My motive?” replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that one ould have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius. “From what otive, in fact, has this convict just said ‘I am a convict’? Well, yes! the otive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, the unfortunate point is that I ave a thread in my heart, which keeps me fast. It is when one is old that that ort of thread is particularly solid. All life falls in ruin around one; one esists. Had I been able to tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot r to cut it, to go far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; here are diligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried o break that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore my heart ith it. Then I said: ‘I cannot live anywhere else than here.’ I must stay. ell, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remain here? You offer me chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is sincerely attached to me, she said o the armchair: ‘Stretch out your arms to him,’ your grandfather demands othing better than to have me, I suit him, we shall live together, and take our eals in common, I shall give Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, t is a habit, we shall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same himney-corner in winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is appiness, that is everything. We shall live as one family. One family!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.62#At that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, glared at the loor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein, and is voice suddenly rose in thundering tones:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.63#“As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours. I do ot belong to any family of men. In houses where people are among themselves, I m superfluous. There are families, but there is nothing of the sort for me. I m an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did I have a father and mother? I lmost doubt it. On the day when I gave that child in marriage, all came to an nd. I have seen her happy, and that she is with a man whom she loves, and that here exists here a kind old man, a household of two angels, and all joys in hat house, and that it was well, I said to myself: ‘Enter thou not.’ I could ave lied, it is true, have deceived you all, and remained Monsieur auchelevent. So long as it was for her, I could lie; but now it would be for yself, and I must not. It was sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true, nd all would go on. You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing; y conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the night in rying to persuade myself to it; you questioned me, and what I have just said to ou is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it; well, yes, I have assed the night in alleging reasons to myself, and I gave myself very good easons, I have done what I could. But there are two things in which I have not ucceeded; in breaking the thread that holds me fixed, riveted and sealed here y the heart, or in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone. hat is why I have come hither to tell you everything this morning. Everything r nearly everything. It is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself; keep that to myself. You know the essential points. So I have taken my mystery nd have brought it to you. And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes. t was not a resolution that was easy to take. I struggled all night long. Ah! ou think that I did not tell myself that this was no Champmathieu affair, that y concealing my name I was doing no one any injury, that the name of auchelevent had been given to me by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude for service rendered to him, and that I might assuredly keep it, and that I should e happy in that chamber which you offer me, that I should not be in any one’s ay, that I should be in my own little corner, and that, while you would have osette, I should have the idea that I was in the same house with her. Each one f us would have had his share of happiness. If I continued to be Monsieur auchelevent, that would arrange everything. Yes, with the exception of my soul. here was joy everywhere upon my surface, but the bottom of my soul remained lack. It is not enough to be happy, one must be content. Thus I should have emained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have concealed my true visage, hus, in the presence of your expansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, in he midst of your full noonday, I should have had shadows, thus, without crying ’ware,’ I should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should ave taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who I was, ou would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself to be served by omestics who, had they known, would have said: ‘How horrible!’ I should have ouched you with my elbow, which you have a right to dislike, I should have ilched your clasps of the hand! There would have existed in your house a ivision of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks; at our most intimate hours, when all hearts thought themselves open to the very ottom to all the rest, when we four were together, your grandfather, you two nd myself, a stranger would have been present! I should have been side by side ith you in your existence, having for my only care not to disarrange the cover f my dreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself upon you who re living beings. I should have condemned her to myself forever. You and osette and I would have had all three of our heads in the green cap! Does it ot make you shudder? I am only the most crushed of men; I should have been the ost monstrous of men. And I should have committed that crime every day! And I hould have had that face of night upon my visage every day! every day! And I hould have communicated to you a share in my taint every day! every day! to ou, my dearly beloved, my children, to you, my innocent creatures! Is it othing to hold one’s peace? is it a simple matter to keep silence? No, it is ot simple. There is a silence which lies. And my lie, and my fraud and my ndignity, and my cowardice and my treason and my crime, I should have drained rop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed it again, I should have inished at midnight and have begun again at midday, and my ‘good morning’ would ave lied, and my ‘good night’ would have lied, and I should have slept on it, I hould have eaten it, with my bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the ace, and I should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the amned soul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Why should I do it? n order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I the right to be happy? I tand outside of life, sir.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.64#Jean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas and of nguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice once more, but t was no longer a dull voice—it was a sinister voice.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.65#“You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked, ou say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? By myself.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.66#And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and xtending it towards Marius:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.67#“Do you see that fist?” he continued. “Don’t you think that it holds that ollar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! conscience is another grasp! f one desires to be happy, sir, one must never understand duty; for, as soon as ne has comprehended it, it is implacable. One would say that it punished you or comprehending it; but no, it rewards you; for it places you in a hell, where ou feel God beside you. One has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is t peace with himself.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.68#And, with a poignant accent, he added:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.69#“Monsieur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, I am an honest man. It is y degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own. This has appened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it was a mere nothing. es, an honest man. I should not be so if, through my fault, you had continued o esteem me; now that you despise me, I am so. I have that fatality hanging ver me that, not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration, hat consideration humiliates me, and crushes me inwardly, and, in order that I ay respect myself, it is necessary that I should be despised. Then I straighten p again. I am a galley-slave who obeys his conscience. I know well that that is ost improbable. But what would you have me do about it? it is the fact. I have ntered into engagements with myself; I keep them. There are encounters which ind us, there are chances which involve us in duties. You see, Monsieur ontmercy, various things have happened to me in the course of my life.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.70#Again Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, as though is words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.71#“When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right to ake others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right to make them lip over one’s own precipice without their perceiving it, one has not the right o let one’s red blouse drag upon them, one has no right to slyly encumber with ne’s misery the happiness of others. It is hideous to approach those who are ealthy, and to touch them in the dark with one’s ulcer. In spite of the fact hat Fauchelevent lent me his name, I have no right to use it; he could give it o me, but I could not take it. A name is an _I_. You see, sir, that I have hought somewhat, I have read a little, although I am a peasant; and you see hat I express myself properly. I understand things. I have procured myself an ducation. Well, yes, to abstract a name and to place oneself under it is ishonest. Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse or a watch. To e a false signature in flesh and blood, to be a living false key, to enter the ouse of honest people by picking their lock, never more to look traightforward, to forever eye askance, to be infamous within the _I_, no! no! o! no! no! It is better to suffer, to bleed, to weep, to tear one’s skin from he flesh with one’s nails, to pass nights writhing in anguish, to devour neself body and soul. That is why I have just told you all this. Wantonly, as ou say.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.72#He drew a painful breath, and hurled this final word:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.76#A silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf of houghts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his mouth on ne of his fingers, which was folded back. Jean Valjean was pacing to and fro. e paused before a mirror, and remained motionless. Then, as though replying to ome inward course of reasoning, he said, as he gazed at the mirror, which he id not see:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.77#“While, at present, I am relieved.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.78#He took up his march again, and walked to the other end of the rawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that Marius was atching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible intonation:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.79#“I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.80#Then he turned fully round towards Marius:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.81#“And now, sir, imagine this: I have said nothing, I have remained Monsieur auchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, I am one of you, I am in my hamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in slippers, in the evening all hree of us go to the play, I accompany Madame Pontmercy to the Tuileries, and o the Place Royale, we are together, you think me your equal; one fine day you re there, and I am there, we are conversing, we are laughing; all at once, you ear a voice shouting this name: ‘Jean Valjean!’ and behold, that terrible hand, he police, darts from the darkness, and abruptly tears off my mask!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.82#Again he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. Jean aljean resumed:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.83#“What do you say to that?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.84#Marius’ silence answered for him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.85#Jean Valjean continued:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.86#“You see that I am right in not holding my peace. Be happy, be in heaven, e the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content therewith, and do not rouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his reast and force his duty to come forth; you have before you, sir, a wretched an.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.87#Marius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to Jean aljean, he offered the latter his hand.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.88#But Marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not ffered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, and it seemed to Marius that he ressed a hand of marble.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.89#“My grandfather has friends,” said Marius; “I will procure your ardon.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.90#“It is useless,” replied Jean Valjean. “I am believed to be dead, and that uffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They are supposed to rot n peace. Death is the same thing as pardon.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.91#And, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort of nexorable dignity:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.92#“Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty; and need but one pardon, that of my conscience.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.93#At that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened gently alf way, and in the opening Cosette’s head appeared. They saw only her sweet ace, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids were still swollen with leep. She made the movement of a bird, which thrusts its head out of its nest, lanced first at her husband, then at Jean Valjean, and cried to them with a mile, so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of a rose:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.94#“I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, instead f being with me!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.95#Jean Valjean shuddered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.96#“Cosette! . . .” stammered Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.97#And he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.98#Cosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There was omething in her eyes like gleams of paradise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.99#“I have caught you in the very act,” said Cosette. “Just now, I heard my ather Fauchelevent through the door saying: ‘Conscience . . . doing my duty . . ’ That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it. People should not talk olitics the very next day. It is not right.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.100#“You are mistaken. Cosette,” said Marius, “we are talking business. We re discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs . . ”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.101#“That is not it at all,” interrupted Cosette. “I am coming. Does anybody ant me here?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.102#And, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room. he was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand folds and arge sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet. In the golden eavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are these charming sacks fit to lothe the angels.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.103#She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, then xclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.105#That said, she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.120#Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.125#Then she presented her brow to Jean Valjean.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.137#“Smile.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.144#“I adore you!” said Cosette.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.145#And they fell irresistibly into each other’s arms.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.146#“Now,” said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, with a riumphant little grimace, “I shall stay.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.147#“No, not that,” said Marius, in a supplicating tone. “We have to finish omething.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.148#“Still no?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.149#Marius assumed a grave tone:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.151#“Ah! you put on your man’s voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father, ave not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you are tyrants.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.152#And she left the room.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.153#Two seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy head was gain thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.154#“I am very angry indeed.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.155#The door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.156#It was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the ight, without itself being conscious of it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.157#Marius made sure that the door was securely closed.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.158#“Poor Cosette!” he murmured, “when she finds out . . .”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.159#At that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed on Marius a ewildered eye.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.160#“Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this. hat is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength for one hing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir, give me your ost sacred word of honor, that you will not tell her. Is it not enough that you hould know it? I have been able to say it myself without being forced to it, I ould have told it to the universe, to the whole world,—it was all one to me. ut she, she does not know what it is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we hould be obliged to explain matters to her, to say to her: ‘He is a man who has een in the galleys.’ She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!” . . . e dropped into an armchair and hid his face in his hands.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.161#His grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders it was vident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.162#There is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sort f convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain reath, letting his arms fall, and allowing Marius to see his face inundated ith tears, and Marius heard him murmur, so low that his voice seemed to issue rom fathomless depths:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.163#“Oh! would that I could die!”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.164#“Be at your ease,” said Marius, “I will keep your secret for myself lone.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.165#And, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to have been, but forced, for he last hour, to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was readful, gradually beholding the convict superposed before his very eyes, upon . Fauchelevent, overcome, little by little, by that lugubrious reality, and ed, by the natural inclination of the situation, to recognize the space which ad just been placed between that man and himself, Marius added:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.166#“It is impossible that I should not speak a word to you with regard to he deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That is an act f probity. It is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you. Fix the um yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not fear to set it very igh.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.167#“I thank you, sir,” replied Jean Valjean, gently.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.168#He remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of his ore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.169#“All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . .”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.170#“What is it?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.171#Jean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, without oice, without breath, he stammered rather than said:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.172#“Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that I ught not to see Cosette any more?”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.173#“I think that would be better,” replied Marius coldly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.174#“I shall never see her more,” murmured Jean Valjean. And he directed his teps towards the door.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.175#He laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. Jean aljean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless for a econd, then closed the door again and turned to Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.176#He was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any tears in is eyes, but only a sort of tragic flame. His voice had regained a strange omposure.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.177#“Stay, sir,” he said. “If you will allow it, I will come to see her. I ssure you that I desire it greatly. If I had not cared to see Cosette, I should ot have made to you the confession that I have made, I should have gone away; ut, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosette is, and to continue to ee her, I had to tell you about it honestly. You follow my reasoning, do you ot? it is a matter easily understood. You see, I have had her with me for more han nine years. We lived first in that hut on the boulevard, then in the onvent, then near the Luxembourg. That was where you saw her for the first ime. You remember her blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des nvalides, where there was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a ittle back court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. That was my life. We ever left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. I was like er own father, and she was my child. I do not know whether you understand, onsieur Pontmercy, but to go away now, never to see her again, never to speak o her again, to no longer have anything, would be hard. If you do not isapprove of it, I will come to see Cosette from time to time. I will not come ften. I will not remain long. You shall give orders that I am to be received in he little waiting-room. On the ground floor. I could enter perfectly well by he back door, but that might create surprise perhaps, and it would be better, I hink, for me to enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I should like to see a ittle more of Cosette. As rarely as you please. Put yourself in my place, I ave nothing left but that. And then, we must be cautious. If I no longer come t all, it would produce a bad effect, it would be considered singular. What I an do, by the way, is to come in the afternoon, when night is beginning to all.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.178#“You shall come every evening,” said Marius, “and Cosette will be waiting or you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.1.179#“You are kind, sir,” said Jean Valjean.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.1#Marius was quite upset.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.2#The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside hom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was something nigmatic about that person, of which his instinct had warned him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.3#This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M. auchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.4#To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one’s happiness resembles he discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.5#Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such a eighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of that man form part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to be done?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.6#Had Marius wedded the convict as well?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.7#In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste the rand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even the rchangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.8#As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked imself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he been anting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he involuntarily ulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered upon this love affair, which ad ended in his marriage to Cosette, without taking sufficient precautions to hrow light upon the surroundings? He admitted,—it is thus, by a series of uccessive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves, that life amends us, ittle by little,—he admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a ort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysms f passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes, and nvades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a onscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once indicated this haracteristic element of Marius’ individuality.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.9#He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet, uring those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to Cosette of hat drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken up such a singular ine of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight. How had it happened hat he had not mentioned this to Cosette? Yet it was so near and so terrible! ow had it come to pass that he had not even named the Thénardiers, and, articularly, on the day when he had encountered Éponine? He now found it almost ifficult to explain his silence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account or it. He recalled his benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, love bsorbing everything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and erhaps also, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this iolent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling him to onceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure, contact with which e dreaded, in which he did not wish to play any part, his agency in which he ad kept secret, and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without eing an accuser.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.10#Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been no ime for anything except love.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.11#In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind, xamined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he had told osette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered that Jean Valjean as a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Would that have changed her, osette? Would he have drawn back? Would he have adored her any the less? Would e have refrained from marrying her? No. Then there was nothing to regret, othing with which he need reproach himself. All was well. There is a deity for hose drunken men who are called lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path hich he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight. Love had andaged his eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.12#But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal ccompaniment.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.13#Marius’ ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Fauchelevent ho had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.14#In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certain urprise.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.15#This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored that eposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.16#He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all, he ad restored it all.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.17#Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him to his. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In this avowal here was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there was acceptance of eril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it is a shelter. A false name s security, and he had rejected that false name. He, the galley-slave, might ave hidden himself forever in an honest family; he had withstood this emptation. And with what motive? Through a conscientious scruple. He himself xplained this with the irresistible accents of truth. In short, whatever this ean Valjean might be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening. here existed some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all ppearances, scruples had for a long time already controlled this man. Such fits f justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures. An awakening f conscience is grandeur of soul.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.19#Here, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. What reathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire? onfidence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.20#In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Marius truck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passive principle, and e tried to reach a balance.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.21#But all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring to form a lear idea of this man, and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak, in the epths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.22#The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession—these were ood. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became black once ore.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.23#Troubled as were Marius’ memories, a shadow of them returned to him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.24#After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had that an taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a omplaint?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.25#Here Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive from ustice, who had broken his ban.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.26#Another question: Why had that man come to the barricade?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.27#For Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had eappeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat. This an had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. What had he come there or? In the presence of this question a spectre sprang up and replied: Javert.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.28#Marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjean dragging he pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heard behind the corner f the little Rue Mondétour that frightful pistol shot. Obviously, there was atred between that police spy and the galley-slave. The one was in the other’s ay. Jean Valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of revenging imself. He had arrived late. He probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. he Corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the aw there; it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half urned towards good; and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal, who is n the path of repentance, may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and nscrupulous in the matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killed Javert. At east, that seemed to be evident.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.29#This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply. his question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass that Jean aljean’s existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long a period?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.30#What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that child n contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forged on igh? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon? So a rime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious galleys of retchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons which is called human estiny, can two brows pass side by side, the one ingenuous, the other ormidable, the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn, the other orever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning? Who could have arranged hat inexplicable pairing off? In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, ad any community of life been established between this celestial little reature and that old criminal?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.31#Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more ncomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved the amb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, during the space of ine years, the angel had had the monster as her point of support. Cosette’s hildhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight, her virginal growth towards ife and light, had been sheltered by that hideous devotion. Here questions xfoliated, so to speak, into innumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms f abysses, and Marius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without becoming izzy. What was this man-precipice?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.32#The old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it now xists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there will always e two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the one which is according o good is Abel; the other which is according to evil is Cain. What was this ender Cain? What was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a irgin, watching over her, rearing her, guarding her, dignifying her, and nveloping her, impure as he was himself, with purity?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.33#What was that cesspool which had venerated that innocence to such a point s not to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean Valjean educating osette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the reservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.34#That was Jean Valjean’s secret; that was also God’s secret.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.35#In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in some ort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this affair as was ean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of the tool which he wills. e is not responsible to men. Do we know how God sets about the work? Jean aljean had labored over Cosette. He had, to some extent, made that soul. That as incontestable. Well, what then? The workman was horrible; but the work was dmirable. God produces his miracles as seems good to him. He had constructed hat charming Cosette, and he had employed Jean Valjean. It had pleased him to hoose this strange collaborator for himself. What account have we to demand of im? Is this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create he rose?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.36#Marius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that they were ood. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points which we have ust indicated, but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it. e adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosette was splendidly pure. That was ufficient for him. What enlightenment did he need? Cosette was a light. Does ight require enlightenment? He had everything; what more could he desire? ll,—is not that enough? Jean Valjean’s personal affairs did not concern im.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.37#And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast, onvulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: “I am nothing to osette. Ten years ago I did not know that she was in existence.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.38#Jean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, he had passed. hatever he was, his part was finished.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.39#Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence to osette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in her lover, er husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took her flight, winged and ransfigured, left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis, Jean aljean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.40#In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to a ertain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we have just ointed out, he felt a _quid divinum_ in that man. But do what he would, and eek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced to fall back upon this: he man was a convict; that is to say, a being who has not even a place in the ocial ladder, since he is lower than the very lowest rung. After the very last f men comes the convict. The convict is no longer, so to speak, in the emblance of the living. The law has deprived him of the entire quantity of umanity of which it can deprive a man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.41#Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though he as a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of hose whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all progress, we admit. e had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that hich is written by God, between law and right. He had not examined and weighed he right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He as not shocked by the word _vindicte_. He found it quite simple that certain reaches of the written law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he ccepted, as the process of civilization, social damnation. He still stood at his point, though safe to advance infallibly later on, since his nature was ood, and, at bottom, wholly formed of latent progress.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.42#In this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous and epulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was for him like he sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after having reflected upon ean Valjean for a long time, his final gesture had been to turn away his head. Vade retro_.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.43#Marius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, while nterrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean had said: “You are onfessing me,” had not, nevertheless, put to him two or three decisive uestions.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.44#It was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but that he ad been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert? Who knows here these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean did not seem like a man ho would draw back, and who knows whether Marius, after having urged him on, ould not have himself desired to hold him back?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.45#Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to stop ur ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked a uestion? It is especially when one loves that one gives way to these xhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinister situations to the ast point, particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally ntermingled with them. What a terrible light might have proceeded from the espairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and who knows whether that hideous lare would not have darted forth as far as Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of nfernal glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel? The pattering of a lightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of uncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the eflections which give color. The purest figures may forever preserve the eflection of a horrible association. Rightly or wrongly, Marius had been fraid. He already knew too much. He sought to dull his senses rather than to ain further light.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.46#In dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to Jean aljean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.47#That man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should he dare o seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow. Who nows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackened forever by it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.48#In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, come nto any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending perplexity to arius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.49#He now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable uestions, before which he had recoiled, and from which an implacable and efinitive decision might have sprung. He felt that he was too good, too gentle, oo weak, if we must say the word. This weakness had led him to an imprudent oncession. He had allowed himself to be touched. He had been in the wrong. He ught to have simply and purely rejected Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean played the art of fire, and that is what he should have done, and have freed his house rom that man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.50#He was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions hich had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. He was displeased with imself.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.51#What was he to do now? Jean Valjean’s visits were profoundly repugnant to im. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did the man want? ere, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he did not wish to enetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. He had promised, he had llowed himself to be drawn into a promise; Jean Valjean held his promise; one ust keep one’s word even to a convict, above all to a convict. Still, his first uty was to Cosette. In short, he was carried away by the repugnance which ominated him.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.52#Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, passing from ne to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profound trouble.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.53#It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, but love is a alent, and Marius succeeded in doing it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.7.2.54#However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was as andid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; he talked of her childhood nd her youth, and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been verything good, paternal and respectable that a man can be towards Cosette. All hat Marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real. That sinister ettle had loved and protected that lily.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.2#Cosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longer xclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, she avoided aying either “father” or “Monsieur Jean.” She allowed herself to be addressed s _you_. She allowed herself to be called Madame. Only, her joy had undergone a ertain diminution. She would have been sad, if sadness had been possible to er.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.3#It is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations in hich the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, and satisfies the eloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own ove.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.4#The lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed the bottles, nd Nicolette the spiders.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.5#All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. He came very day, because he had not the strength to take Marius’ words otherwise than iterally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when Jean aljean came. The house grew accustomed to the novel ways of M. Fauchelevent. oussaint helped in this direction: “Monsieur has always been like that,” she epeated. The grandfather issued this decree:—“He’s an original.” And all was aid. Moreover, at the age of ninety-six, no bond is any longer possible, all is erely juxtaposition; a newcomer is in the way. There is no longer any room; all abits are acquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormand sked nothing better than to be relieved from “that gentleman.” He dded:—“Nothing is more common than those originals. They do all sorts of queer hings. They have no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still worse. He bought palace that he might lodge in the garret. These are fantastic appearances that eople affect.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.6#No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, who could ave guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this description in India. The ater seems extraordinary, inexplicable, rippling though there is no wind, and gitated where it should be calm. One gazes at the surface of these causeless bullitions; one does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.7#Many men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon which gnaws hem, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resembles other men, he oes and comes. No one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain ith a thousand teeth, which lives within the unhappy man, and of which he is ying. No one knows that this man is a gulf. He is stagnant but deep. From time o time, a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his urface. A mysterious wrinkle is formed, then vanishes, then reappears; an ir-bubble rises and bursts. It is the breathing of the unknown beast.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.8#Certain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people are taking heir leave, keeping in the background when other people are displaying hemselves, preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the all-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk, preferring the deserted street, voiding any share in conversation, avoiding crowds and festivals, seeming at ne’s ease and living poorly, having one’s key in one’s pocket, and one’s candle t the porter’s lodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, scending the private staircase,—all these insignificant singularities, fugitive olds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.9#Many weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possession of osette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care of the house, leasures, great matters. Cosette’s pleasures were not costly, they consisted in ne thing: being with Marius. The great occupation of her life was to go out ith him, to remain with him. It was for them a joy that was always fresh, to go ut arm in arm, in the face of the sun, in the open street, without hiding hemselves, before the whole world, both of them completely alone.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.10#Cosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette, the oldering of two elderly maids being impossible, and she went away. The randfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; Aunt Gillenormand eacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her, beside the new household. ean Valjean came every day.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.11#The address as _thou_ disappeared, the _you_, the “Madame,” the “Monsieur ean,” rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which he had himself aken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became more and more gay and ess and less tender. Yet she still loved him sincerely, and he felt it.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.12#One day she said to him suddenly: “You used to be my father, you are no onger my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you were onsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don’t like all this. If did not know how good you are, I should be afraid of you.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.2.13#He still lived in the Rue de l’Homme Armé, because he could not make up is mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt.

He caught her up: “Say Jean.”—“Ah! ruly,” she replied with a burst of laughter, “Monsieur Jean.”—“That is right,” aid he. And he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes.

No more familiarity, no more good-morning with a kiss, never more that ord so profoundly sweet: “My father!” He was at his own request and through his wn complicity driven out of all his happinesses one after the other; and he had his sorrow, that after having lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards bliged to lose her again in detail.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.3.2#The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In short, t sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day. His whole life as concentrated in that one hour.

Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful.”—And away they litted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of the Rue Plumet roduced on them the effect of the dawn. They already had behind them in life omething which was like the springtime of their love. The house in the Rue lumet being held on a lease, still belonged to Cosette. They went to that arden and that house. There they found themselves again, there they forgot hemselves. That evening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue des illes-du-Calvaire.—“Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet returned,” asque said to him. He seated himself in silence, and waited an hour. Cosette id not return. He departed with drooping head.

In this manner, Jean Valjean contrived to remain a long ime.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.3.21#It was so sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated his ounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce: “M. illenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served.”

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.3.38#Jean Valjean found not a word to answer. Cosette probably expected some xplanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to the Rue de ’Homme Armé; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of ntering his own house, he entered the adjoining dwelling. It was only after aving ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down gain.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.8.4.2#There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeing othing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemed to be star to him, which never varied, and which was no other than the corner of the ue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer he approached the corner of the street he more his eye lighted up; a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward urora, he had a fascinated and much affected air, his lips indulged in obscure ovements, as though he were talking to some one whom he did not see, he smiled aguely and advanced as slowly as possible. One would have said that, while esirous of reaching his destination, he feared the moment when he should be lose at hand. When only a few houses remained between him and that street which ppeared to attract him his pace slackened, to such a degree that, at times, one ight have thought that he was no longer advancing at all. The vacillation of is head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic eedle seeking the pole. Whatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to rrive at last; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, he rembled, he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner f the last house, and gazed into that street, and there was in that tragic look omething which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible, and the eflection from a paradise that was closed to him. Then a tear, which had slowly athered in the corner of his lids, and had become large enough to fall, rickled down his cheek, and sometimes stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted ts bitter flavor. Thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone, hen he returned by the same road and with the same step, and, in proportion as e retreated, his glance died out.

His tears were lso exhausted; they no longer collected in the corner of his eye-lid; that houghtful eye was dry.

He had confined himself to gradually estranging Jean Valjean from his ouse and to effacing him, as much as possible, from Cosette’s mind. He had, in manner, always placed himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in his way, she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more than ffacement, it was an eclipse.

Her bedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She as not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this.

It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have elsewhere said, looks before her.” Nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and hose who are departing. Those who are departing are turned towards the shadows, hose who are arriving towards the light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the art of the old, and involuntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first nsensible, increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, ithout becoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault of heirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love. Old age oes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but there is no onger a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off of life; old eople, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children.

Then, no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation, he made n effort, drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself. He put on is old workingman’s clothes.

He caught sight of himself in his mirror, and did not recognize himself. He was eighty years old; before arius’ marriage, he would have hardly been taken for fifty; that year had ounted for thirty. What he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age, t was the mysterious mark of death. The hollowing of that pitiless nail could e felt there. His cheeks were pendulous; the skin of his face had the color hich would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it; the corners of is mouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs.

It does not cost more than thirty sous, and s much better. Buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast, by eans of this wax, to a little framework of black iron.

He as dressed in black from head to foot, in garments that were very threadbare ut clean; a bunch of seals depending from his fob suggested the idea of a atch. He held in his hand an old hat!

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.27#There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue eautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was to change illains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have proved embarrassing or the villain. The change was on sight, for a day or two, at the rate of hirty sous a day, by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the orld in general as nearly as possible. This costumer was called “the Changer”; he pickpockets of Paris had given him this name and knew him by no other. He ad a tolerably complete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out people ere almost probable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of his hop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a magistrate, here the outfit of a Curé, beyond the outfit of a banker, in one corner the ostume of a retired military man, elsewhere the habiliments of a man of etters, and further on the dress of a statesman.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.28#This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays in aris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into which roguery etreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room, deposited his thirty ous and selected, according to the part which he wished to play, the costume hich suited him, and on descending the stairs once more, the knave was a omebody. On the following day, the clothes were faithfully returned, and the hanger, who trusted the thieves with everything, was never robbed. There was ne inconvenience about these clothes, they “did not fit”; not having been made or those who wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose for another and id not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell hort of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer’s costumes. It was ecessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean. The Changer had oreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the species from the irst rascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin, neither tall nor hort. Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the hanger’s clients extricated themselves as best they might. So much the worse or the exceptions! The suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to oot, and consequently proper, would have been too large for Pitt and too small or Castelcicala. The costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the hanger’s catalogue; we copy:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.29#“A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots nd linen.” On the margin there stood: _ex-ambassador_, and a note which we also opy: “In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, and two mall quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton.” All this belonged to the tatesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole costume was, if we may so express urselves, debilitated; the seams were white, a vague button-hole yawned at one f the elbows; moreover, one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast; but his was only detail; as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into is coat and laid upon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent utton.

Rapid as it was, this glance was of the kind which a man ecognizes when he has once beheld it; it did not escape Marius.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.118#His eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places and umps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nose had ecome as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey eappeared.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.119#“Monsieur le Baron is infallible,” he said in a clear voice whence all asal twang had disappeared, “I am Thénardier.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.120#And he straightened up his crooked back.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.121#Thénardier, for it was really he, was strangely surprised; he would have een troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. He had come to bring stonishment, and it was he who had received it. This humiliation had been worth ive hundred francs to him, and, taking it all in all, he accepted it; but he as nonetheless bewildered.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.122#He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite of his isguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, and recognized him thoroughly. nd not only was this Baron perfectly informed as to Thénardier, but he seemed ell posted as to Jean Valjean. Who was this almost beardless young man, who was o glacial and so generous, who knew people’s names, who knew all their names, nd who opened his purse to them, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid hem like a dupe?
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.123#Thénardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius’ eighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he had formerly, in vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor young man named Marius who ived in the house. He had written to him, without knowing him, the letter with hich the reader is acquainted.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.124#No connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possible n his mind.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.125#As for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefield f Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which he always ntertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression f thanks.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.126#However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of the arried pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personal researches, e had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the depths of his own gloom, e had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew. He had discovered, by int of industry, or, at least, by dint of induction, he had guessed who the man as whom he had encountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he ad easily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was osette. But he meant to be discreet in that quarter.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.127#Who was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catch n inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to him quivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order to cause himself o be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had, better wares than that or sale. And, according to all appearances, if he were to come and make to the aron Pontmercy this revelation—and without proof: “Your wife is a bastard,” the nly result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the evealer.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.128#From Thénardier’s point of view, the conversation with Marius had not yet egun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified his strategy, to have bandoned his position, to have changed his front; but nothing essential had een compromised as yet, and he had five hundred francs in his pocket. Moreover, e had something decisive to say, and, even against this very well-informed and ell-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt himself strong. For men of Thénardier’s ature, every dialogue is a combat. In the one in which he was about to engage, hat was his situation? He did not know to whom he was speaking, but he did know f what he was speaking, he made this rapid review of his inner forces, and fter having said: “I am Thénardier,” he waited.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.129#Marius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thénardier at last. That an whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He could honor olonel Pontmercy’s recommendation.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.130#He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this illain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his ather upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. It also seemed to im, in the complex state of his mind towards Thénardier, that there was ccasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a ascal. In any case, he was content. He was about to deliver the Colonel’s shade rom this unworthy creditor at last, and it seemed to him that he was on the oint of rescuing his father’s memory from the debtors’ prison. By the side of his duty there was another—to elucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette’s ortune. The opportunity appeared to present itself. Perhaps Thénardier knew omething. It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.131#He commenced with this.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.132#Thénardier had caused the “honest rustler” to disappear in his fob, and as gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.133#Marius broke the silence.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.134#“Thénardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have me ell you your secret—the one that you came here to reveal to me? I have nformation of my own, also. You shall see that I know more about it than you o. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin and a thief.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.135#“I don’t understand, sir,” ejaculated Thénardier.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.136#“I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pas e Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice, and who, nder the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status and rehabilitated imself. This man had become a just man in the full force of the term. In a rade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he made the fortune of an entire ity. As far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also, but as a econdary matter, and in some sort, by accident. He was the foster-father of the oor. He founded hospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young irls, supported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of he country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated convict new the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days; he denounced im, and had him arrested, and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause he banker Laffitte,—I have the fact from the cashier himself,—by means of a alse signature, to hand over to him the sum of over half a million which elonged to M. Madeleine. This convict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. s for the other fact, you have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean Valjean illed the agent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. I, the person who is peaking to you, was present.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.137#Thénardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who ays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, in one nstant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returned instantly. The nferior’s triumph in the presence of his superior must be wheedling.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.138#Thénardier contented himself with saying to Marius:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.140#And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an xpressive whirl.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.141#“What!” broke forth Marius, “do you dispute that? These are facts.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.142#“They are chimæras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors me enders it my duty to tell him so. Truth and justice before all things.

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.152#Thénardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient lexandrine measure:

urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.155#Thénardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, which eemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.156#“I have my papers,” he said calmly.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.157#And he added:
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.158#“Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean horoughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M.

Not manuscript proofs—writing is suspicious, handwriting s complaisant,—but printed proofs.”
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.159#As he spoke, Thénardier extracted from the envelope two copies of ewspapers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One of these two ewspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags, seemed much older than he other.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.160#“Two facts, two proofs,” remarked Thénardier. And he offered the two ewspapers, unfolded, to Marius.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.161#The reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, a umber of the _Drapeau Blanc_ of the 25th of July, 1823, the text of which can e seen in the first volume, established the identity of M. Madeleine and Jean aljean.
urn:cts:fuLit:vhugo.lesmis.hapgood:5.9.4.162#The other, a _Moniteur_ of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the suicide f Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to the prefect hat, having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, e had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who, holding him under is pistol, had fired into the air, instead of blowing out his brains.

He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, these wo newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up hénardier’s statements; the note printed in the _Moniteur_ had been an dministrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. Marius could not oubt.

I say kilfully, because, by a gift of that nature it would not be so very unskilful o slip into an honorable house whose comforts one would then share, and, at the ame stroke, to conceal one’s crime, and to enjoy one’s theft, to bury one’s ame and to create for oneself a family.”

It was the sound of footsteps, some one was walking in he dark, and coming in his direction. Strange to say, there was another man in he sewer besides himself. The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far ff. A little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the ewcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something on his back. He was alking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a bent attitude was an x-convict, and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse. ssassination caught in the very act, if ever there was such a thing. As for the heft, that is understood; one does not kill a man gratis. This convict was on is way to fling the body into the river. One fact is to be noticed, that before eaching the exit grating, this convict, who had come a long distance in the ewer, must, necessarily, have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems s though he might have left the body, but the sewermen would have found the ssassinated man the very next day, while at work on the quagmire, and that did ot suit the assassin’s plans. He had preferred to traverse that quagmire with is burden, and his exertions must have been terrible, for it is impossible to isk one’s life more completely; I don’t understand how he could have come out f that alive.”

The passer-by said to the nhabitant:—“You see what I have on my back, I must get out, you have the key, ive it to me.” That convict was a man of terrible strength. There was no way of efusing. Nevertheless, the man who had the key parleyed, simply to gain time. e examined the dead man, but he could see nothing, except that the latter was oung, well dressed, with the air of being rich, and all disfigured with blood. hile talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off behind, without the ssassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man’s coat. A document for onviction, you understand; a means of recovering the trace of things and of ringing home the crime to the criminal. He put this document for conviction in is pocket. After which he opened the grating, made the man go out with his mbarrassment on his back, closed the grating again, and ran off, not caring to e mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be resent when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river. Now you omprehend. The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; the one who ad the key is speaking to you at this moment; and the piece of the coat . . ”

I knew well that thou till felt friendly towards thy poor old man. How kind it was of thee to place hat pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me a little, wilt thou not? Not oo much. I do not wish thee to have any real griefs. You must enjoy yourselves great deal, my children. I forgot to tell you that the profit was greater till on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest. A gross of a dozen ozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty. It really was a good business. So here is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, Monsieur ontmercy. It is honest money. You may be rich with a tranquil mind. Thou must ave a carriage, a box at the theatres now and then, and handsome ball dresses, y Cosette, and then, thou must give good dinners to thy friends, and be very appy. I was writing to Cosette a while ago. She will find my letter. I bequeath o her the two candlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece. They are of ilver, but to me they are gold, they are diamonds; they change candles which re placed in them into wax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gave hem to me is pleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I could. My hildren, you will not forget that I am a poor man, you will have me buried in he first plot of earth that you find, under a stone to mark the spot. This is y wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come for a little while now nd then, it will give me pleasure. And you too, Monsieur Pontmercy. I must dmit that I have not always loved you. I ask your pardon for that. Now she and ou form but one for me. I feel very grateful to you. I am sure that you make osette happy. If you only knew, Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy cheeks were y delight; when I saw her in the least pale, I was sad. In the chest of rawers, there is a bank-bill for five hundred francs. I have not touched it. It s for the poor. Cosette, dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed? dost hou recognize it? That was ten years ago, however. How time flies! We have been ery happy. All is over. Do not weep, my children, I am not going very far, I hall see you from there, you will only have to look at night, and you will see e smile. Cosette, dost thou remember Montfermeil? Thou wert in the forest, thou ert greatly terrified; dost thou remember how I took hold of the handle of the ater-bucket? That was the first time that I touched thy poor, little hand. It as so cold! Ah! your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white ow. And the big doll! dost thou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thou egrettedest not having taken her to the convent! How thou didst make me laugh ometimes, my sweet angel! When it had been raining, thou didst float bits of traw on the gutters, and watch them pass away. One day I gave thee a willow attledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and green feathers. Thou hast orgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thou didst play. Thou didst put herries in thy ears. Those are things of the past. The forests through which ne has passed with one’s child, the trees under which one has strolled, the onvents where one has concealed oneself, the games, the hearty laughs of hildhood, are shadows. I imagined that all that belonged to me. In that lay my tupidity. Those Thénardiers were wicked. Thou must forgive them. Cosette, the oment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother. She was called Fantine. emember that name—Fantine. Kneel whenever thou utterest it. She suffered much. he loved thee dearly. She had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness. hat is the way God apportions things. He is there on high, he sees us all, and e knows what he does in the midst of his great stars. I am on the verge of eparture, my children. Love each other well and always. There is nothing else ut that in the world: love for each other. You will think sometimes of the poor ld man who died here. Oh my Cosette, it is not my fault, indeed, that I have ot seen thee all this time, it cut me to the heart; I went as far as the corner f the street, I must have produced a queer effect on the people who saw me ass, I was like a madman, I once went out without my hat. I no longer see learly, my children, I had still other things to say, but never mind. Think a ittle of me. Come still nearer. I die happy. Give me your dear and well-beloved eads, so that I may lay my hands upon them.”

That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time, of ampness, of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds. The water turns t green, the air blackens it. It is not near any path, and people are not fond f walking in that direction, because the grass is high and their feet are mmediately wet. When there is a little sunshine, the lizards come thither.

It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, to Italy as well as to rance, to Germany as well as to Ireland, to Republics which have slaves as well s to Empires which have serfs. Social problems overstep frontiers. The sores of he human race, those great sores which cover the globe, do not halt at the red r blue lines traced upon the map. In every place where man is ignorant and espairing, in every place where woman is sold for bread, wherever the child uffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which hould warm him, the book of _Les Misérables_ knocks at the door and says: “Open o me, I come for you.”

In spite of our possessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin, Florence, Sienna, Pisa, antua, Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, Venice, a heroic history, sublime ruins, agnificent ruins, and superb cities, you are, like ourselves, poor. You are overed with marvels and vermin. Assuredly, the sun of Italy is splendid, but, las, azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man.

You taste nothing of the present or of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it. You have a arbarian, the monk, and a savage, the lazzarone. The social question is the ame for you as for us. There are a few less deaths from hunger with you, and a ew more from fever; your social hygiene is not much better than ours; shadows, hich are Protestant in England, are Catholic in Italy; but, under different ames, the _vescovo_ is identical with the _bishop_, and it always means night, nd of pretty nearly the same quality.

Do you chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant f the meaning of those gloomy words: public prosecution, legal infamy, prison, he scaffold, the executioner, the death penalty? Italians, with you as with us, eccaria is dead and Farinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize your state easons. Have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and olitics?
